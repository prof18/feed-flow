  <h1>FeedFlow</h1>
</div>

FeedFlow is a minimalistic RSS Reader that I've built for myself and that's now available on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux.

The majority of websites with an RSS feed don't share the article's content because they want you to go on their website. For this reason, FeedFlow always opens the original website, but you can choose the browser that you want (on mobile). For example, you can open an article on DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus with all the trackers disabled and then just kill all the navigation data. In this way, the reading experience is separated from your main browser instance.

Your existing RSS collection can be easily imported: FeedFlow offers full and easy import and export capabilities through OPML files.

Feel free to open an issue (or, even better, a PR :)) if something is not working or if you want to propose a new feature.

## Tech Stack

FeedFlow is built with Jetpack Compose, Compose Multiplatform, and SwiftUI. All the logic is shared using Kotlin Multiplatform.

FeedFlow uses [RSSParser](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser), an RSS parsing library I've built for Android, which is now Multiplatform!

You can get the latest Linux version 

You can also download the latest macOS, Linux and Windows versions from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/prof18/feed-flow/releases/latest),
or use [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/feedflow) for macOS.

```bash
brew install --cask feedflow
```

## Building the project üõ†Ô∏è

To build the project, some setup is required:

### Android

The `google-services.json` is required to build the project. You can generate a fake one with this command:

```bash
cp config/dummy-google-services.json androidApp/src/debug/google-services.json
cp config/dummy-google-services.json androidApp/src/release/google-services.json
```

or use the `fdroid` variant. 

The dropbox sync won't work because the Dropbox API key is not included in the repository. 
You can generate your own key and add it in the `keystore.properties` file.

```properties
dropbox_key=your_key
```

### iOS

Create a copy of the `FeedFlow.xcconfig` file with the following command:

```bash
cp iosApp/Assets/FeedFlow.xcconfig.template iosApp/Assets/FeedFlow.xcconfig
```

Fill in the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX` values. The first is your Apple Team ID. The latter is your domain in reverse notation or what you use as the prefix for your projects.

The `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for release and dev variants) is required to build the project. You can generate a fake one with this command:

```bash
cp config/dummy-google-service.plist iosApp/GoogleService-Info-dev.plist
cp config/dummy-google-service.plist iosApp/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

The dropbox sync won't work because the Dropbox API key is not included in the repository.
You can generate your own key and add it on the `Config.xcconfig` file. You can generate the file with the following command:

```bash
cp iosApp/Assets/Config.xcconfig.template iosApp/Assets/Config.xcconfig
```

### Desktop

To run the desktop version, run the following Gradle task:

```bash
./gradlew desktopApp:run
```

The dropbox sync won't work because the Dropbox API key is not included in the repository.
You can generate your own key and add it in the `desktopApp/src/jvmMain/resources/props.properties` file.

```properties
dropbox_key=your-key
```

## Translating üåç

If you want to help translate FeedFlow, I will be more than happy.

To add a new translation, you can use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/feedflow/) or open a pull request with a new `strings.xml` file inside the `i18n/src/commonMain/resources/locale/values-<language-code>/strings.xml` folder and new files inside the `assets/storecopy/<language-code>` folder (where `<language-code>` is a [two-letter ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)).
