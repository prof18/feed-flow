Follow your favorite RSS feeds with FeedFlow, a minimalistic RSS Reader. Enjoy a clutter-free reading experience, as FeedFlow offers a minimalistic list and opens the articles on their respective websites or in reader mode.

Tailor your browsing experience by choosing your preferred browser. This way, you can select your favorite privacy-focused browser to separate your reading experience from your main browser. And if you want to avoid the browser, FeedFlow offers a reader mode to enjoy the content of the articles without any distractions.

Transitioning to FeedFlow is a breeze. Your existing RSS collection can be imported with our full and easy import and export capabilities through OPML files, ensuring a seamless reading experience.

Just focus on reading (or scrolling)!

The app is still in development, so some features may be missing or there may be issues. Please report any bugs or feature suggestions!
