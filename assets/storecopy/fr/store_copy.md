Follow your favorite RSS feeds with FeedFlow, a minimalistic and opinionated RSS Reader. Enjoy a clutter-free reading experience as FeedFlow offers a minimalistic list and it opens the articles on their respective websites.

Tailor your browsing experience by choosing your preferred browser. This way, you can choose your favorite privacy-focused browser to separate your reading experience from your main browser.

Your existing RSS collection can be easily imported: FeedFlow offers full and easy import and export capabilities through OPML files.

Just focus on reading (or scrolling)!

The app is still in development, so some features could be missing or there could be some issues. Please report any kind of bugs or feature suggestions!
