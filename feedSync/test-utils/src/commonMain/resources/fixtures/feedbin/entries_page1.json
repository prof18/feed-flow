A lot of those deals are ongoing, so it\u2019s worth revisiting that story as you start your holiday shopping in earnest.</p>\n<p id=\"p3\">However, today, I wanted to hit the highlights of what we\u2019ve covered over the past week on MacStories Deals and add some new deals to the mix that you probably haven\u2019t seen yet, so buckle up, it\u2019s time to go shopping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"macstories-pixel-icons\">MacStories Pixel Icons</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/001/2020-06-04-17-18-39.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p5\">All three <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/pixel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Pixel Icon sets are 40% off</a> until Monday, December 1.</p>\n<p id=\"p6\">Two of the icon sets are specially-designed for Shortcuts. We\u2019ve all been there. You work hard on a shortcut and want to give it the perfect icon, only to realize that Apple doesn\u2019t offer what you want in the Shortcuts app. The MacStories Pixel Icons fill that gap with an extensive set of painstakingly hand-crafted icons with multiple color options created by MacStories\u2019 long-time designer, <a href=\"https://mastodon.macstories.net/@silvia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Silvia Gatta</a>. We also offer a set of Perspective icons that are perfect for OmniFocus Pro and other uses.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\"><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/pixel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit our dedicated MacStories Pixel page today</a> to preview all three icon sets and purchase them for 40% off until Monday, December 1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apple-hardware\">Apple Hardware</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764336940692-1764339098398.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul9\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Xnyqjl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13\u201d M4 MacBook Air</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/43RIlBt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15\u201d M4 MacBook Air</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rrqsn1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iPad mini</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4itZRlk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AirPods 4 without ANC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iruvfc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AirPods 4 with ANC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4okGA76\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Pencil Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3M9ZNLm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AirTags 4-Pack</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p10\">There are a lot of Black Friday deals on Apple hardware, but most of them are good, not great. I\u2019m picky, so I\u2019m only going to focus on just the great deals.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">One of the best deals on Apple hardware during Black Friday is the M4&nbsp;13\u201d MacBook Air with 16GB of memory and 256GB of storage. If you want more memory or storage than that, you\u2019ll have to settle for a smaller percentage discount, but even with more memory and more storage, you\u2019re still doing better than any other deal this year. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Xnyqjl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15\u201d M4 MacBook Air</a> with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD is a good deal, too.</p>\n<p id=\"p12\">Among the many iPad deals, the best is on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rrqsn1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 128GB iPad mini</a> with an A17 Pro chip. I\u2019ve had a mini since they were released and love it. The size makes it an excellent reading and video-watching device.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\">AirPods 4 are also heavily discounted for Black Friday. Apple\u2019s most affordable wireless earbuds come with active noise cancellation and without. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4itZRlk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The model with no active noise cancellation</a> slightly edges out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iruvfc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the model with ANC</a> as far as the discounts are concerned, but both models are a bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"p14\">However, the very best deals available from Apple in terms of the percentage discount are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3M9ZNLm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a 4-pack of AirTags</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4okGA76\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Apple Pencil Pro</a>. If you need either, now is the perfect time to buy them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-home\">Smart Home</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764337148071-1764339098214.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul16\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44e4ZnC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XWl5i8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aqara U100 Smart Lock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/487xkyy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aqara M3 Home Hub</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iAnrgf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aqara 4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pzsWht\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ecobee Smart Video Doorbell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XTe01N\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Narwal Freo X10 Pro</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p17\">The holiday season is a great time to catch up on projects and start new ones. For me, that\u2019s often tuning up my smart home setup and setting up some new devices thanks to Black Friday sales. Here are the best ones I\u2019ve seen:</p>\n<p id=\"p18\">Aqara already makes some of the most affordable smart home devices out there, so you really can\u2019t go wrong with their Black Friday deals. One of my favorites is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/44e4ZnC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FP2 Presence Sensor</a>. It\u2019s far more sophisticated than a simple motion sensor. To start with, it can tell when you\u2019ve left a room, which motion sensors can\u2019t do. I\u2019ve used an FP2 Sensor in my office to control lighting for a couple of years, <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/posts/presence-based-automations-with-the-aqara-fp2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote about it for Club members</a>, and have been really happy with it.</p>\n<p id=\"p19\">Other great deals from Aqara include its <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XWl5i8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U100 Smart Lock</a> that works with Apple Home Key and HomeKit, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/487xkyy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aqara M3 Home Hub</a> that I recently set up at home and love, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iAnrgf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro</a>, an outdoor HomeKit camera that <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/rugged-reliable-and-homekit-ready-a-review-of-aqaras-g5-pro-outdoor-camera-hub/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I reviewed earlier this year</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p20\">My Aqara 4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro is paired with an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pzsWht\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ecobee Smart Video Doorbell</a>, which is also on sale for Black Friday. I\u2019ve used various Ecobee smart home products for years and have never been disappointed. The same goes for its smart doorbell. I\u2019ve had it installed for over a year, and it\u2019s been reliable despite facing the sun on some very hot summer days.</p>\n<p id=\"p21\">Black Friday is also a great time to buy a robot vacuum and mop. There are lots of deals, but the model I\u2019ve tested for the past couple of months and love is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XTe01N\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Narwal Freo X10 Pro</a>. It handles vacuuming and mopping, navigating via LiDAR and does an excellent job compared to other robot vacuums I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ll be reviewing the Freo X10 Pro about it soon, but now\u2019s the time to get it at a steep discount.</p>\n<p id=\"p22\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"batteries-and-chargers\">Batteries and Chargers</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764337282915-1764338988423.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul24\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ktn7mP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker SOLIX C1000 Gen 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pj5Nj4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker SOLIX C300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4p7S6Ea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4adtwNp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UGREEN 200W Nexode Wall Charger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44n3408\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UGREEN 300W Nexode Charging Station</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rpiRp7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UGREEN 500W Nexode Charging Station</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p25\">I\u2019ve had the first generation <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ktn7mP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker SOLIX C1000 battery</a> since August, and it\u2019s a great backup system in the event the power goes out. In fact, its 1,024Wh capacity is enough to keep my entire Mac setup running for around seven hours. It\u2019s big and heavy, but with five standard U.S. wall outlets, two 140W USB-C ports, a 123W USB-A, and a 15W USB-C port, the C1000 is a versatile backup battery.</p>\n<p id=\"p26\">One of the early Black Friday deals I picked up for myself was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pj5Nj4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker\u2019s SOLIX C300</a>. It\u2019s deeply discounted and strikes a great balance between energy storage and size storing 288Wh of energy (which is the equivalent of nine 10,000mAh battery packs) in a package that\u2019s just under 8 inches tall and 5 inches wide and deep. We have variable rate pricing on electricity where I live, so I\u2019ve been charging the C300 when electricity is cheap and charging all my devices when it\u2019s not. The capacity is enough to charge my MacBook Pro and have plenty left over for my iPhone, and anything else that needs a charge. It has a light and a car charger, too.</p>\n<p id=\"p27\">If that\u2019s too much battery for you, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4p7S6Ea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anker\u2019s 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank</a>, which is an excellent Black Friday deal option, too. The battery can output 250W total and has three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A. I\u2019ve used this battery for a couple of years, and what I like most about it is that it comes with a magnetic base that charges at 170W, recharging it fully in around 37 minutes. The base has two USB-C and one USB-A port, so it can serve as a wall-powered charging hub, too.</p>\n<p id=\"p28\">If batteries aren\u2019t your thing, UGREEN has some excellent deals on wall chargers ranging from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4adtwNp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the compact Nexode 200W GaN wall charger</a> that outputs 200W total and has four USB-C and 1 USB-A port to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rpiRp7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 500W Nexode charging station</a> with five USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, and a single USB-C port output of up to 240W. In between is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/44n3408\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a 300W Nexode charging station</a> with four USB-C ports and one USB-A port. All three are deeply discounted for Black Friday and are a great way to charge multiple devices simultaneously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"headphones\">Headphones</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764337449420-1764338928315.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul30\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iu3CXY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beats Studio Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4omO8pZ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beats Solo 4 headphones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pHBao1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sony WH-1000XM5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KjDWkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rkeGuF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bose QuietComfort Headphones</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p31\">In addition to the AirPods 4 that I mentioned above, there are other deals, including from Beats, which has great deals on the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iu3CXY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beats Studio Pro</a>, which I bought for myself as an early holiday gift, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4omO8pZ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beats Solo 4 headphones</a>. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pHBao1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sony\u2019s ultra-popular WH-1000XM5</a> wireless noise-cancelling headphones, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KjDWkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4</a> wireless headphones, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rkeGuF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Bose QuietComfort Headphones</a> are great bargains, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wearables\">Wearables</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764337721895-1764338928081.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul33\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ik1eTq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oura Ring 4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4p7UU4f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XReal One glasses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pv8fTN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XReal One Pro glasses</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p34\">Oura is new to Amazon, and the company is making a splash with a big discount on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ik1eTq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Oura Ring 4</a>, the latest version of the sleep and fitness tracking ring. If a smart watch isn\u2019t your thing, the Oura Ring 4 is an excellent alternative way to get the benefits of heart rate and sleep tracking.</p>\n<p id=\"p35\">AR glasses continue to improve, allowing you to use your computer, watch TV and movies, and play games on a huge virtual display. One of the leaders among the companies developing AR glasses is XReal, whose glasses Federico and I have both used. For Black Friday, XReal is offering a great deal on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4p7UU4f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the XReal One glasses</a> and a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pv8fTN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smaller discount on the Pro model</a>, both of which could make for a fun holiday season AR project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"videogame-hardware-and-accessories\">Videogame Hardware and Accessories</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-1764337884796-1764338928477.png\"><p></p></div>\n<ul id=\"ul37\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49FsVnB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GMKtec AI Mini PC Ryzen Al Max+ 395</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rrkaDV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASUS ROG Swift 32\u201d 4K OLED Gaming Monitor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ols9Q6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sony PS5 Disk Edition (slim)</a></li>\n<li>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4olnkGI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sony DualSense</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pEVfLF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8BitDo\u2019s Pro 3 Bluetooth Controller</a> for Switch/Switch 2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4omHD6z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8Bitdo Ultimate 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pEs4It\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GameSir G8 Plus</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p38\">I spend <em>a lot</em> of time researching the latest gaming hardware for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/npc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>, and there are some great deals out there this year. One of the most exciting announcements in gaming this year is that Valve is releasing a Steam Machine early next year \u2013 a sort of more powerful Steam Deck designed to be connected to your TV.</p>\n<p id=\"p39\">One of the most intriguing aspects of Valve\u2019s plans that we discuss on <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/npc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">next week\u2019s episode of NPC</a> is that the beta version of its operating system, SteamOS, has already been adapted to run on some desktops. That means it\u2019s already possible to configure a PC with specs that are as good or better than a Steam Machine today. If that\u2019s your sort of thing, one of the most interesting options is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/49FsVnB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GMKtec AI Mini PC Ryzen Al Max+ 395</a>, a mini PC with a footprint that\u2019s similar to a Mac Studio, but shorter. With specs that beat what Valve has said about the Steam Machine, this mini PC is a great option for experimentation, which I\u2019d pair with an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rrkaDV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASUS ROG Swift 32\u201d 4K OLED Gaming Monitor</a>, one of the most highly-rated OLED gaming displays to be released this year. Both it and the GMKtec mini PC are heavily discounted for Black Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"p40\">You don\u2019t see deals on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ols9Q6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Sony PS5 console</a> very often, but Amazon has a good deal right now on the slim edition with built-in drive. At this point in the current generation of consoles, Sony\u2019s PS5 has an excellent catalog of games, making this an excellent Black Friday deal if you\u2019ve been waiting for the best time to buy a PS5.</p>\n<p id=\"p41\">A lot of great controllers are on sale for Black Friday, too. Here are some of my favorites:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul42\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4olnkGI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sony DualSense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pEVfLF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8BitDo\u2019s Pro 3 Bluetooth Controller</a> for Switch/Switch 2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4omHD6z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8Bitdo Ultimate 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pEs4It\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GameSir G8 Plus</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"miscellany\">Miscellany</h2>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-18-1764338928414.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p44\">There are a lot of other excellent Black Friday deals this year worth considering:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul45\"><li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49Ev17b\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beats Pill</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XV9akI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philips Hue Festavia 65-foot string lights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/44w9qdF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logitech MX Creative Console</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4imz5ey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Satechi FindAll Smart Glasses Case with Find My</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/48662sh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insta360\u2019s Link 2&nbsp;4K Webcam</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4p6ni6A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coway Airmega HEPA Air Purifier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4okM7KU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3M70KnK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon 16GB Kindle Paperwhite</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p46\">That\u2019s it for this year\u2019s Black Friday roundup.

The updates have been slow to roll out and have been met with resistance from Apple, but we\u2019re starting to see policy updates, like developers\u2019 ability to offer <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/developers-and-platforms-react-as-app-store-rules-change-in-the-u-s/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">web-based purchases</a>, translate into new business models, expanding the kinds of apps that are available.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\">Political and regulatory pressures on Apple continued to affect the apps we use this year, too, but the lion\u2019s share of the change we saw in 2025 came from more traditional sources. This year, it was great to see a surge in app innovation sparked by <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/apple-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other AI services</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/liquid-glass/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquid Glass</a> design language, and other new APIs and features from Apple. The result has been a broad-based acceleration of app innovation that we expect to continue into 2026 and beyond. But before looking ahead to what\u2019s next, it\u2019s time to pause as we do each year to reflect on the many apps we tried in 2025 and recognize the best among them.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/group-left-close-1765746853199.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p7\">This year, the MacStories team picked the best apps in six categories:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul8\"><li>Best New App</li>\n<li>Best New Feature</li>\n<li>Best Watch App</li>\n<li>Best Mac App</li>\n<li>Best Design</li>\n<li>App of the Year</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p9\"><a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories</a>&nbsp;members were part of the selection process, too, picking the winner of the MacStories Selects Readers\u2019 Choice Award.

This year\u2019s winner, which joins past winners:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul10\"><li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Transit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/ios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixelmator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pcalc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PCalc</a>, and&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p11\">is the subject of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-macstories-selects-2025-lifetime-achievement-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a special story</a>&nbsp;that Federico wrote for the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"p12\">As usual, Federico and I also recorded <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/465\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a special episode of AppStories</a> covering all the winners and runners-up.

One of the first utilities in this collection was Quick Reviews, a simple way to create a shareable image of a movie you\u2019ve watched. The image includes your review, rating, and a poster in the color scheme of your choice.</p>\n<p id=\"p26\">I really liked this utility on the desktop, but the web app was calling out for a native iOS version. This year, Matt created precisely that, alongside three other apps. (He\u2019s had a very busy year.) However, it\u2019s not just a like-for-like copy of the web version, but a fully formed mobile app that integrates both first- and third-party APIs \u2013 and one I now use shortly after the credits roll on any movie I watch.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_quick-reviews-1765459729115.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p28\">Another place movie lovers like me log what we watch is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letterboxd</a>, and Quick Reviews smartly integrates with the popular movie community platform to pull in your latest activity. You can, of course, create a review from scratch in Quick Reviews, but this integration is ideal for someone who wants to share their views on a movie in a visually delightful way with minimal effort, just by auto-importing a title they\u2019ve already logged on Letterboxd.</p>\n<p id=\"p29\">Like Matt\u2019s other apps, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-reviews/id6740369719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quick Reviews</a> is a simple concept that\u2019s well thought out and executed, making it a joy to use. It\u2019s now part of my movie-watching ritual, and I suspect that\u2019s the case for many others. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to name Quick Reviews the Best New App of 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"p30\"><strong>Learn more about Quick Reviews:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul31\"><li><a href=\"https://quickreviews.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-reviews/id6740369719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-new-app-runners-up\">Best New App Runners-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p32\"></p><center id=\"center33\">\n<h2 id=\"wispr-flow\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-52-20-1765817548450.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p35\"><strong>Federico:</strong> Look, I don\u2019t know if the issue is that I\u2019m becoming a worse typer or that Apple\u2019s software keyboard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hksVvXONrIo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has gotten progressively worse</a>, but the thing is, over the past year, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m sending texts with more typos than ever. Sometimes, I don\u2019t catch those typos in time, messages are sent with them, and \u2013 if I can \u2013 I use the \u2018Edit\u2019 feature in iMessage or Slack to fix them. But other times I <em>do</em> see my typos, and I spend way too much time dealing with the iPhone\u2019s keyboard and text cursor to fix them. It\u2019s exhausting. So months ago I decided to go all-in on embracing dictation as a way to write messages in Slack, Messages, and <a href=\"https://superhuman.com/products/mail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Superhuman</a>, as well as to append quick notes to my Notion, and the best app I\u2019ve found to do this on all my devices, but especially on iOS, is <a href=\"https://wisprflow.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p36\">Wispr Flow is part of a new wave of dictation apps that leverages LLMs under the hood to understand you in multiple languages (including a mix of languages within the same sentence), learns from you over time, and supports a custom dictionary of words to make sure that specific terms aren\u2019t misspelled. Wispr Flow became popular on macOS and Windows first, but a few months ago, it launched on iOS, too, with a genius implementation of AI-based dictation: the app is a custom keyboard that you can use anywhere. To make it work in the background after the first launch, the app uses a Live Activity that persists in the Dynamic Island/Lock Screen and can be terminated at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"p37\">Wispr Flow on iOS has been a game changer for me when it comes to sending long messages to my team on Slack or responding to a long iMessage thread with John. The app syncs my custom dictionary and snippets with the Mac, and the performance has been <em>outstanding</em> with my Pro account, both in terms of speed and overall accuracy. Wispr\u2019s dictation on iOS is leagues ahead of the experience provided by Apple \u2013 so much so that I\u2019ve outright disabled iOS\u2019 default dictation and solely rely on Wispr Flow\u2019s now.</p>\n<p id=\"p38\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow for iOS</a> is arguably the best third-party keyboard I\u2019ve ever tested, combined with two modern technologies (AI speech-to-text and Live Activities) that make it one of the most exciting app debuts on Apple platforms this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p39\"><strong>Learn more about Wispr Flow:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul40\"><li><a href=\"https://wisprflow.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p41\"></p><center id=\"center42\">\n<h2 id=\"activas\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/activas-intelligent-wellness/id6749898750\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activas</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-19-45-43-1765241150328.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p44\"><strong>John:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/activas-modern-design-with-a-sprinkling-of-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I just reviewed Activas</a> by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@brianhough\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Hough</a> last week and can\u2019t recommend it highly enough. Apple\u2019s Health app contains a wealth of information, but it\u2019s not always presented in the most meaningful way for users, and it rarely puts pieces of information together in a way that paints a complete picture.</p>\n<p id=\"p45\">That\u2019s where <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/activas-intelligent-wellness/id6749898750\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activas</a> excels. Using the same data paired with modern design and explanations generated by carefully controlled AI prompts, the app presents your health data with graphs and text that are more meaningful for someone trying to understand how their health and fitness fit together.</p>\n<p id=\"p46\">Activas shares the Health app\u2019s approach to privacy, too. Your data remains on your device, and the AI insights are also generated on-device. I appreciate the constrained use of AI here as well. Activas includes a chatbot, but the questions you can ask are predefined, lowering the risk of potentially harmful hallucinations. This limits what you can get out of the Activas AI feature, but it doesn\u2019t ruin the experience. Instead, the concise, focused responses fit in nicely with the design of the rest of the app, giving users a wealth of glanceable information to help them track their health and fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"p47\"><strong>Learn more about Activas:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul48\"><li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/activas-modern-design-with-a-sprinkling-of-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/3/#buttons-toolbars-and-tab-bars\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iOS and iPadOS 26: The MacStories Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/appstories/id1227872143\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AppStories, Episode 452: iOS, iPadOS, and macOS 26: The MacStories Reviews</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-new-feature\">Best New Feature</h2>\n<p id=\"p49\"></p><center id=\"center50\">\n<h2 id=\"matters-text-to-speech\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-save-read-grow/id1501592184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matter\u2019s Text-to-Speech</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/feature-1765746855597.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p52\"><strong>Federico:</strong> I\u2019ve gone back and forth between read-later apps over the years. It\u2019s been a <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/210\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recurring</a> topic on <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AppStories</a>; I\u2019ve written up several shortcuts for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-starter-pack-reverse-engineering-the-matter-api-and-my-save-to-matter-shortcut/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories</a> and the <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/posts/importing-goodlinks-articles-into-readwise-reader-via-the-api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club</a> involving different apps; I\u2019ve tried my best to keep our Discord members up to date on my latest read-later workflow whenever possible. This year alone, I switched multiple times between <a href=\"https://goodlinks.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoodLinks</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Readwise Reader</a>, and <a href=\"https://web.getmatter.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matter</a>. Ultimately, though, I always went back to Matter, primarily for two reasons:</p>\n<ol id=\"ol53\"><li>I really, <em>really</em> like the people behind the app and their <a href=\"https://x.com/benspringwater/status/1874271814509379683\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stories</a>.</li>\n<li>Matter\u2019s <strong>text-to-speech feature</strong> for listening to articles is the best one I\u2019ve ever tested in 16 years of writing about apps.</li>\n</ol><p id=\"p54\">Now, unfortunately, we\u2019re not giving out awards to our favorite people here (but maybe we should), so I\u2019ll just focus on the app. Matter is an exquisitely designed read-later app for iOS, iPadOS, and the web that has wholly embraced Liquid Glass and is better because of it. Toolbars and tab bars float gracefully above text and get out of the way when not needed, putting the focus on the actual content you want to read; when they animate, they do so beautifully with liquid effects that feel right at home in iOS 26. I know that the point of a read-later app isn\u2019t to look pretty, but after all, we\u2019re all Apple users here, and if we thought about user experience like that, we would have used Linux \u2013 and we don\u2019t. (Shout-out to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SteamOS</a>, though.)</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-55-17-1765817734166.png\" alt=\"Listening to an article in Matter.\"><p>Listening to an article in Matter.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p56\">The fact that Matter looks great helps, but for me this year, the reason it\u2019s stood out among the competition has been its incredible text-to-speech functionality that lets you listen to articles and newsletters as if they were podcast episodes. I don\u2019t know with absolute certainty which AI provider the Matter team is using (my theory is that it\u2019s a non-compressed version of <a href=\"https://unrealspeech.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unreal\u2019s voices</a>, though I may be wrong), but we should applaud their business decision to support high-quality voices (which tend to be expensive for developers, especially when not compressed) and the UI they designed around them. Matter\u2019s audio player \u2013 again, <em>thanks</em> to Liquid Glass \u2013 natively docks at the bottom of the page, just like Music, when you\u2019re listening to a story. Tap on it, and you\u2019ll be presented with a full-screen audio player that includes playback controls, menus for speed and voices, and even a sleep timer.</p>\n<p id=\"p57\">I\u2019ve tried several read-later apps over the years, and particularly in the past year, I\u2019ve focused my research on finding the best-sounding AI voices for catching up on my read-later queue while I\u2019m doing other things throughout the day. The simple reality is that Matter\u2019s implementation of text-to-speech has allowed me to \u201cread\u201d more, be more informed, and stay inspired. For all these reasons, Matter\u2019s text-to-speech functionality is the Best New Feature for MacStories Selects 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"p58\"><strong>Learn more about Matter:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul59\"><li><a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-save-read-grow/id1501592184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/matter-a-fresh-take-on-read-later-apps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-new-feature-runners-up\">Best New Feature Runners-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p60\"></p><center id=\"center61\">\n<h2 id=\"longplays-mcp-integration\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/longplay/id1495152002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay\u2019s MCP Integration</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-15-at-17-53-12-2x-1765817615663.png\" alt=\"Using Longplay for Mac in Claude.\"><p>Using Longplay for Mac in Claude.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p63\"><strong>Federico:</strong> <a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay</a>, created by indie developer <a href=\"https://adrian.schoenig.me\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adrian Sch\u00f6nig</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-2-0-an-album-oriented-apple-music-player-with-loads-of-new-features/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long been</a> one of our favorite companion apps for Apple Music that puts the focus on listening to albums rather than playlists or algorithmic discovery. And earlier this year, Sch\u00f6nig was one of the first developers to pioneer a new frontier for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/hybrid-automation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hybrid automation</a> in macOS apps with <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/455\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration</a> in Longplay for Mac.</p>\n<p id=\"p64\">As <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-for-mac-launches-with-powerful-ai-and-shortcuts-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John explained in our review</a> a few months ago, the MCP integration in Longplay allows you to query your Apple Music library with natural language, leveraging the processing capabilities of Claude to explore your library and control music playback in a way that isn\u2019t possible with Apple Music and the Music app alone. Thanks to a built-in installation flow based on the native <code>.mcpb</code> bundle format, Longplay can be added as a native connector to Claude, which gives the assistant a variety of tools to find albums and collections, play media, and control playback. In less than 30 seconds, you can enable an integration that lets you ask questions like, <em>\u201cWhich albums have I added to my library lately?\u201d</em> or send commands like, <em>\u201cCreate a collection of Oasis singles and B-sides,\u201d</em> and have Claude complete those requests from its chat interface. This feature is excellent, and it\u2019s a fantastic example of how AI can complement human creativity and music enjoyment without displacing them.</p>\n<p id=\"p65\"><a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay</a> and its MCP server for Mac played an important role in my decision to try Apple Music again after a year spent using Spotify. Exploring the nooks and crannies of my music library is an experience I\u2019ve never had before with any music streaming service, and as it stands right now, it\u2019s exclusively made possible by Longplay and Sch\u00f6nig\u2019s vision for a different kind of music search. If you\u2019re an Apple Music subscriber (or a lapsed one, like I used to be) and have Claude installed on your Mac, you owe it to yourself to play around with Longplay\u2019s MCP integration.</p>\n<p id=\"p66\"><strong>Learn more about Longplay:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul67\"><li><a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/longplay/id1495152002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-for-mac-launches-with-powerful-ai-and-shortcuts-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p68\"></p><center id=\"center69\">\n<h2 id=\"bridges-shortcuts-actions\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridges\u2019 Shortcuts Actions</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-22-04-40-1765253103346.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p71\"><strong>Devon:</strong> I\u2019ve been using <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridges</a>, the app for saving, organizing, and sharing links from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@refactoredd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan Ruiz</a>, in my regular workflow for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/magic-rays-of-light/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Rays of Light</a> for years now, and it is excellent. No other app offers both the organizational features and flexibility that Bridges does for storing links to share in podcast show notes, YouTube video descriptions, newsletters, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"p72\">If you\u2019re the type of person who needs a tool like Bridges, you\u2019re also likely someone who tends to automate their workflows as much as possible. That\u2019s where the app\u2019s Shortcuts actions, introduced this fall, come in. Bridges\u2019 Shortcuts integration includes a comprehensive set of actions that allow you to perform all of the app\u2019s core functionalities \u2013 saving links, sharing folders of URLs in various formats, searching through stored links, and more \u2013 without opening the app at all. Even better, the actions are all customizable, giving you the capability to tweak them and combine them with other actions to fit your exact use cases.</p>\n<p id=\"p73\">Before it added Shortcuts actions, Bridges was already my favorite way to create show notes for the podcast; now, the app makes me feel like I have superpowers. Using a shortcut I built with Bridges\u2019 actions, I can save a link from any app to the precise section and in the exact format that I want it in my show notes, and I\u2019m even able to further act on those links depending on which section I save them to, such as automatically adding a movie trailer to my queue in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play</a>. When it comes time to actually put out an episode, a single run of another shortcut generates my show notes in the precise format I need them for publishing and clears out my saved links in preparation for the next episode.</p>\n<p id=\"p74\">Bridges\u2019 integration with Shortcuts is an excellent example of how well-implemented automation tools can empower users to make an app their own, get things done more efficiently, and spend more time creating. It\u2019s a fantastic addition to an already very powerful app, and one that\u2019s made my life easier on a weekly basis ever since it was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"p75\"><strong>Learn more about Bridges:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul76\"><li><a href=\"https://www.bridgesapp.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-watch-app\">Best Watch App</h2>\n<p id=\"p77\"></p><center id=\"center78\">\n<h2 id=\"athlytic\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/watch-1765746852953.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p80\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a> has been on the scene for several years, and so far, it\u2019s flown under most people\u2019s radars. However, the two-person development team has continued to add value to the app at an impressive rate. It\u2019s a fitness app that aims to help you train smarter and learn more about your metrics, such as sleep quality, recovery, and energy levels, with easily accessible data points that are clearly laid out and explained. Athlytic touts its use of AI, but it\u2019s important to note that all results you are presented with, including recovery, battery, and sleep debt, are obtained by analyzing hard data from your Apple Watch.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_athlytic-watch-1765459726027.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p82\">While the iOS version is wide in scope, what\u2019s impressive about its watchOS counterpart is how it trims down various areas while still feeling full-featured and valuable on a day-to-day basis. Your key statistics \u2013 recovery, exertion, sleep, energy, stress, and battery \u2013 are available on the main screen for you to glance at or, with a further tap, analyze in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"p83\">You can kick off a workout from within the app without your iPhone, too. One of the frustrations of Apple\u2019s Fitness and Workout apps on watchOS is the limited amount of post-workout data there is for you to review. It\u2019s fine for casual users, but Athlytic provides so much more, and in a way that doesn\u2019t overwhelm you.</p>\n<p id=\"p84\">I\u2019ve noted Athlytic in my past two annual <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/watchos-reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watchOS reviews</a> as something Apple should take note of in its first-party efforts. If you\u2019re interested in delving deeper into your fitness and health statistics, Athlytic is a valuable app to have on your wrist, and it well deserves this year\u2019s MacStories Selects Award for Best Watch App.</p>\n<p id=\"p85\"><strong>Learn more about Athlytic:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul86\"><li><a href=\"https://www.athlyticapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-watch-app-runner-up\">Best Watch App Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p87\"></p><center id=\"center88\">\n<h2 id=\"%c2%b5browser\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00b5Browser</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_ubrowser-1765459725303.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p90\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> The Apple Watch was never meant to be used for browsing the web. If it were, you know Apple would have built a version of Safari for watchOS. That said, one of the enormous benefits of having an Apple Watch is that it negates the need to pull your iPhone out of your pocket every time you get a message or a notification. We\u2019ve all fallen into that trap of checking a text only to discover we\u2019re suddenly ten minutes into a social media scroll.</p>\n<p id=\"p91\">This is where having a browser on your wrist like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00b5Browser</a> (\u201c\u00b5\u201d means \u201cmicro\u201d in Greek) can be helpful. Typing a URL into the app \u2013 or better yet, opening a bookmark saved using its iOS version \u2013 will display a website on the small Apple Watch screen. There are limitations to what watchOS allows, so you won\u2019t see any flashy animations, but text-based sites work great. This is perfect for a quick check of the headlines without the danger of doomscrolling.</p>\n<p id=\"p92\">In the latest version of \u00b5Browser for watchOS 26, developer <a href=\"https://mastodon.online/@arno_app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arno Appenzeller</a> has added support for the new Controls API. This puts your favorite websites just a tap away inside Control Center. \u00b5Browser does one thing, and it does it well, and support for new watchOS features (not too common this year) adds a lot of value to this clever little utility.</p>\n<p id=\"p93\"><strong>Learn more about \u00b5Browser:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul94\"><li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-mac-app\">Best Mac App</h2>\n<p id=\"p95\"></p><center id=\"center96\">\n<h2 id=\"bloom\"><strong><a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloom</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/mac-app-1765746852890.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p98\"><strong>John:</strong> Replacements for the Mac\u2019s Finder have been around a long time, but I never really felt the need to use one until about a year ago. Part of it was the increasing burden of managing dozens of articles and podcast production files every week, but the change was also driven by the lack of interesting Finder improvements over the past several years. As with most of the core apps I use for my work, I felt it was time to shake things up a little and see if there was something better out there. It turns out there is: <a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloom</a> by <a href=\"https://asiafu.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asia Fu</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p99\">Bloom has so many of the qualities that we love at MacStories. It\u2019s a native app that you\u2019ll feel right at home in, and it\u2019s actively developed with new features and refinements coming out at a remarkable clip. But best of all, it manages to tuck a lot of innovative features into a package that feels familiar, which makes it easy to get up and running fast but also do more than you can in Finder.</p>\n<p id=\"p100\">The star of the show is Bloom\u2019s ability to create multi-pane views. There are 12 pane configurations, ranging from a single pane that entirely fills the app\u2019s window to a four-pane quadrant setup. My personal favorite is a three-pane view with a bigger pane on the left and a couple of smaller ones on the right. It\u2019s perfect for my podcast production workflow, allowing me to put working files in the left pane and completed audio and video files in the right two panes.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-08-33-18-2x-1765632839782.png\" alt=\"A Bloom workspace I saved for producing NPC: Next Portable Console.\"><p>A Bloom workspace I saved for producing NPC: Next Portable Console.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p102\">What\u2019s especially nice is that you can save pane configurations as presets that Bloom calls Workspaces. For me, that\u2019s meant setting up workspaces for each of the podcasts I produce. When it\u2019s time to start processing audio and editing, I can quickly open a window with my predefined panes from the app\u2019s toolbar or with a keyboard shortcut.</p>\n<p id=\"p103\">Speaking of which, Bloom allows users to define keyboard shortcuts for virtually every aspect of the app. It also supports AppleScript, so automating your workflows is relatively simple, even though the app doesn\u2019t support Shortcuts directly.</p>\n<p id=\"p104\">Probably the most unique feature of Bloom is the Portal, a mini window that supports most of the app\u2019s core features and can be pinned on top of other windows. The approach is flexible enough to allow the Portal to serve as an alternative to a shelf utility app or simply as a way to conserve screen space when you need to access files in a folder repeatedly while working in another app.</p>\n<p id=\"p105\">Search is different in Bloom than in the Finder, too, and a little hard to get used to at first. However, if you invest time in learning how it works, it pays dividends. Using a global keyboard shortcut, you can quickly jump to any folder by typing its name. It works like \u2018Go to Folder\u2019 in the Finder, but from anywhere. Plus, it also handles keyword searches for files. Unlike the Finder, which defaults to searching your Mac\u2019s entire drive, typing \u2318+F automatically searches the folder you\u2019re viewing, too. Best of all, both search methods are extremely fast.</p>\n<p id=\"p106\">Other notable features include:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul107\"><li>a built-in archive file viewer,</li>\n<li>the ability to navigate a folder in one pane while displaying its content in the pane to its right,</li>\n<li>automatic resizing of columns, making list views far more readable,</li>\n<li>a menu bar app for accessing your favorites, folders, workspaces, and locations,</li>\n<li>built-in image editing tools, and</li>\n<li>a keyboard shortcut to open the folder you are viewing in Terminal or another terminal app.</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p108\">There\u2019s even more to Bloom than that, which is why I haven\u2019t reviewed the app on MacStories before now. It\u2019s so deep that I still feel like I\u2019m discovering new ways to use it, and all the while, the developer continues to add new features. But that depth and dynamism are precisely why Bloom is our Mac App of the Year. It\u2019s easy to use, but built with the power user in mind, rewarding the curious with thoughtful and unique ways to manage your files.</p>\n<p id=\"p109\"><strong>Learn more about Bloom:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul110\"><li><a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/461\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AppStories, Episode 461: Our Latest App and Automation Experiments</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-mac-app-runner-up\">Best Mac App Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p111\"></p><center id=\"center112\">\n<h2 id=\"supercharge\"><strong><a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supercharge</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-09-19-37-2x-1765635670180.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p114\"><strong>John:</strong> <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sindre Sorhus</a> has a lot of apps on the App Store for all of Apple\u2019s platforms, and I use many of them. Some are simple utilities that do one thing well, like <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/week-number\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Week Number</a> putting the week number in your Mac\u2019s menu bar. <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supercharge</a> is a menu bar app, too, but it\u2019s different because it collects a wide variety of utilities under one icon.</p>\n<p id=\"p115\">The kinds of tools and tweaks you\u2019ll find in Supercharge are often available other ways but are buried deep in System Settings or require a trip to the Terminal. With Supercharge, not only can you access all these tools in one central location, but you can also set keyboard shortcuts for each, and the app comes with an extensive collection of Shortcuts actions.</p>\n<p id=\"p116\">Supercharge includes ways to:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul117\"><li>manage windows and notifications,</li>\n<li>eject drives, </li>\n<li>set light, dark, and other modes, </li>\n<li>sleep your displays,</li>\n<li>mute your Mac\u2019s microphone,</li>\n<li>and much more.</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p118\">Besides the actions available in the menu bar, there are many more tweaks available in Supercharge\u2019s settings that alter the Dock and how windows, apps, the menu bar, the Finder, and Mission Control work. Plus, the app installs a long list of services that add actions that can be taken on folders and files with a right-click, including \u2018AirDrop\u2019, \u2018Copy Path\u2019, \u2018Move to\u2026\u2019, \u2018Copy to\u2026\u2019, \u2018Toggle Hidden Files\u2019, and more. Supercharge also includes a built-in utility to debug keyboard shortcut conflicts, which I greatly appreciate because new apps I install are forever colliding with other apps and shortcuts I\u2019ve created.</p>\n<p id=\"p119\">Ultimately, though, Supercharge\u2019s utility isn\u2019t any one of its features; it\u2019s the collection itself that brings disparate functionality together under one easily accessible roof. It\u2019s also the kind of app where it pays off to scroll through its actions and various tweaks now and then. There are so many that they\u2019re hard to absorb in one sitting. Instead, by revisiting the app periodically, you\u2019ll discover new things to add to your toolbox as your workflows evolve.</p>\n<p id=\"p120\"><strong>Learn more about Supercharge:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul121\"><li><a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1749879483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comfort Zone, Episode 48: Raycast Does This</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1749879483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comfort Zone, Episode 42: Should We Do a Conclave?</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-design\">Best Design</h2>\n<p id=\"p122\"></p><center id=\"center123\">\n<h2 id=\"sequel\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequel</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/design-1765746855569.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p125\"><strong>Devon:</strong> MacStories readers will no doubt recognize <a href=\"https://mastodon.design/@rlfb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romain Lefebvre</a>\u2019s media tracker <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequel</a> from past editions of the MacStories Selects Awards. The app took home <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-app-update\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best App Update in 2023</a> and was a runner up for both <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2024-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-new-feature-runners-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best New Feature</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2024-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#readers-choice-runner-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Readers\u2019 Choice Award</a> last year. This year, the app has won Best Design, and if you\u2019ve been paying attention to its development this fall, you already know why.</p>\n<p id=\"p126\">Sequel has been through a lot of changes over its lifespan, but one thing it\u2019s always been great at is applying the latest available technologies to the challenge of media tracking in a way that benefits users. We saw this last year with <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-3s-magic-lookup-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-apps-should-integrate-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Lookup\u2019s practical application of AI</a>, and it\u2019s happened again this year with Sequel\u2019s implementation of Liquid Glass. Lefebvre has not only applied Liquid Glass in a way that complements Sequel\u2019s distinctive look while keeping it in step with Apple\u2019s latest design standards, but he\u2019s also taken it as an opportunity to rethink the app\u2019s navigation on iPhone and deliver a much-requested feature: universal search.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-22-07-13-1765253250756.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p128\">As <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/3/#buttons-toolbars-and-tab-bars\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federico pointed out in his review of iOS 26</a>, Sequel on the iPhone is taking advantage of the fact that Liquid Glass makes tab bars for apps with simple navigation much more attractive than before. The app\u2019s two navigation tabs, Saved and Collections, house the majority of its functionality and make it really simple to switch between the two. I\u2019ve certainly found myself taking advantage of the Collections feature more often now that it\u2019s readily available from anywhere in the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p129\">Also now available from anywhere is search, the app\u2019s third navigation button residing in the bottom-right corner of the iPhone UI. In Liquid Glass fashion, the button expands upon being pressed into a search bar that allows you to look for content across media types. Not only is the search feature more easy to access with this design, but it\u2019s also more complete, incorporating search from within the user\u2019s libraries and from Sequel\u2019s databases in one set of results \u2013 capabilities that used to be found in separate parts of the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p130\">Of course, Sequel users on other platforms benefit from these changes, too. Universal search is available via the sidebar on iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro, where the app\u2019s libraries and collections also reside. Buttons and menus throughout the app have been redesigned with Liquid Glass as well, and every version of Sequel features a gorgeous new media detail view with header images that morph seamlessly into blurred backgrounds as you scroll.</p>\n<p id=\"p131\">Put all of this together, and you\u2019ve got a design that\u2019s modern, fluid, and functional while still letting your content and artwork take center stage. Sequel\u2019s design has always stood out as admirable, considered, and self-assured. Now, it\u2019s award-worthy.</p>\n<p id=\"p132\"><strong>Learn more about Sequel:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul133\"><li><a href=\"https://www.getsequel.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-0-an-iphone-and-ipad-media-tracker-that-strikes-an-elegant-balance-between-form-and-function/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-design-runner-up\">Best Design Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p134\"></p><center id=\"center135\">\n<h2 id=\"not-boring-camera\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(Not Boring) Camera</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_not-boring-camera-1765459732299.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p137\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> No design can please everyone, but it\u2019s frustrating when app developers consider design far down on their list of priorities. That\u2019s why it\u2019s great to see apps take big swings with bold, unique designs. This is precisely the mentality that <a href=\"https://notbor.ing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Not Boring Software</a> has been following for the past few years, and it continues with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(Not Boring) Camera</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p138\">(Not Boring) Camera is the closest you\u2019ll get to the feel of a real camera on a flat screen. One of its key features is a massively customizable \u201couter case\u201d, which you can configure with a selection of color scheme presets or a color scheme you define yourself. Once you\u2019ve chosen your colors, you can go ahead and start taking pictures. The app uses animations and haptics to enhance the experience even more, fooling you into thinking \u2013 if just for a moment \u2013 that you\u2019re using a real camera.</p>\n<p id=\"p139\">Thankfully, the app\u2019s appeal doesn\u2019t end with visual customization. (Not Boring) Camera uses styles to directly manipulate your photos as you take them. You can even import your own custom <a href=\"https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-lut/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LUTs</a> for a really pro-level finish, and the developers have collaborated with photographers to create original styles for the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p140\">All of this custom photography is easily accessible via a chunky UI, making shooting easy. No more fiddly dials or switches; the design is both aesthetic and functional.</p>\n<p id=\"p141\">(Not Boring) Camera is a pro-level camera app that combines fun with a genuine love and knowledge of photography. Even if you\u2019re not a photographer, you\u2019ll want to keep coming back for the delight you get when using this unique app design.</p>\n<p id=\"p142\"><strong>Learn more about (Not Boring) Camera:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul143\"><li><a href=\"https://notbor.ing/product/camera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/posts/not-boring-camera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories Coverage</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"readers-choice-award\">Readers\u2019 Choice Award</h2>\n<p id=\"p144\"></p><center id=\"center145\">\n<h2 id=\"alfred\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alfred</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/readers-choice-1765746855602.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p147\"><strong>John:</strong> I enjoy the Readers\u2019 Choice selection process every year. We start by asking <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the full Club MacStories membership</a> to nominate their favorite apps of the year. Then, <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/plans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plus and Premier members</a> vote on the nominees. The fun part is seeing what apps have readers\u2019 mindshare as the nominations and votes come in.</p>\n<p id=\"p148\">This year was a little different than most. Often, readers choose an app that was released in the last year or two, which makes sense; MacStories readers love to try new apps. But every so often, the stars align and a classic app that\u2019s been around for a long time recaptures the imaginations of readers. This year, that app is <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alfred</a> by <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Running with Crayons</a>, which Club MacStories readers picked for this year\u2019s Readers\u2019 Choice Award.</p>\n<p id=\"p149\">Alfred\u2019s history stretches back to 2010 when <a href=\"https://qsapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QuickSilver</a>, arguably the spark that started the entire launcher app category, began to fade as its development was open-sourced and slowed. In the years since, Alfred has been one of the pillars of the launcher category because it can do so much more than just launch apps. Other apps came and went, but Alfred has continued to evolve and remains a core must-have utility for a legion of Mac users.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-09-17-59-2x-1765635501240.png\" alt=\"Alfred is highly customizable.\"><p>Alfred is highly customizable.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p151\">Alfred is an excellent pick for the Readers\u2019 Choice Award in any year, but I suspect it was <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-26-tahoe-the-macstories-review/3/#spotlight\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple\u2019s expansion of Spotlight</a> in macOS Tahoe that recaptured Mac users\u2019 imaginations. Spotlight\u2019s updates in macOS Tahoe are excellent, but as with any system feature, an alternative like Alfred does so much more. Apple undoubtedly brought more people to the launcher category and reminded others of the value of third-party apps that offer even more.</p>\n<p id=\"p152\">What I love about the launcher category is that these apps start with the simple idea of invoking a hotkey to take actions on your Mac. But that\u2019s where the differences start to multiply. Sure, you can search for folders and files, launch an app or shortcut, and manage your clipboard in any of them. However, with Alfred, you also get a powerful in-app automation system that can do things that are difficult or impossible to accomplish in Shortcuts. Plus, its keyboard-driven approach to productivity is more intuitive and thoughtful than most launchers I\u2019ve tried.</p>\n<p id=\"p153\">I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what Alfred can do, but what makes it special isn\u2019t a list of features. What sets Alfred apart is that it can be whatever its users want to make of it. If all you want to do is launch apps with Alfred, you can do that, but if you want to use it to launch scripts in the Terminal or create complex workflows, you can do that, too. It\u2019s an app that can grow with you as your own work evolves, and it comes with <a href=\"https://www.alfredforum.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a built-in, active community</a> that has created all sorts of automations you can install and start using without ever dipping into workflows yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"p154\">It\u2019s easy to see why Alfred is the 2025 MacStories Selects Readers\u2019 Choice Award winner. It\u2019s a time-tested, feature-rich utility with a keyboard-driven approach to computing that taps into the power of the Mac and makes it more accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"p155\"><strong>Learn more about Alfred:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul156\"><li><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/accessing-shortcuts-for-mac-with-alfred-workflows-and-universal-actions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accessing Shortcuts for Mac with Alfred Workflows and Universal Actions</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"app-of-the-year\">App of the Year</h2>\n<p id=\"p157\"></p><center id=\"center158\">\n<h2 id=\"drafts\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/app-of-the-year-1765746852457.jpg\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p160\"><strong>Federico:</strong> 2025 has been the year that <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a>, the excellent text editor by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@agiletortoise\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greg Pierce</a>, finally clicked for me. I know it sounds ironic given that I first reviewed Drafts <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all the way back in 2012</a> when it started as a simple scratchpad for jotting down quick ideas in plain text and sending them to a few compatible extensions. 13 years later, however, the combination of Drafts\u2019 unrelenting evolution, Greg Pierce\u2019s support for the app over the years, and its constant embrace of new Apple technologies have made this app one of the essential tools in my daily workflow on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>\n<p id=\"p161\">What\u2019s different for Drafts in 2025 is its unique mix of traditional scripting techniques, native app integrations, and the assistance of AI and LLMs to create even <em>more</em> actions you can use in the app. For the first time in years, I realized not only that could I use Drafts as a simple notepad for jotting down random ideas and bits of text or URLs, but also that I could transform it into a powerful text editor \u2013 sort of reminiscent of Obsidian \u2013 with custom actions tailored for me, which <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/464\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I vibe-coded using Claude</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p162\">This all started months ago, when I realized that modern LLMs are pretty good at writing JavaScript code and integrating with external web APIs. Drafts has long supported custom JS actions, including the ones based on <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/scripting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a JavaScript library created by Greg Pierce himself</a> specifically for the app.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-50-27-1765817438693.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p164\">Years ago, I did try to learn my way around JavaScript. We\u2019re talking before AI, before LLMs, when I attempted to piece together custom actions based on JavaScript by Googling around or copying and pasting code that I didn\u2019t even understand from StackOverflow, Reddit, and forums on the Internet. I remember that I put together some pretty useful actions back in the day, and that showed me the potential for turning Drafts into a highly customizable, powerful text editor with my own actions and custom UIs. This year, however, I realized that I could just use Claude to take that idea to the next level.</p>\n<p id=\"p165\">Over the past few months, I\u2019ve created a series of actions by prompting Claude, transforming Drafts from a relatively simple utility into the native equivalent of Obsidian: an app that\u2019s deeply integrated with iOS, Liquid Glass, Apple dictation, and native UI elements, but also one that is powered by custom actions for Notion, Todoist, Markdown processing, and all the other services that I use on a daily basis. After months of iteration, the result is something unique in the app landscape on iOS: a text editor that doesn\u2019t sacrifice native compatibility with the latest Apple APIs in favor of customization, but instead offers a customizable text environment that is <em>always</em> integrated with all of the latest technologies that Apple rolls out every September.</p>\n<p id=\"p166\">It also helps that Drafts was, of course, updated on day one for Liquid Glass, iPadOS 26, and the new APIs in the 26 family of OSes that Apple launched a few months ago. You can find Drafts in Shortcuts, on the Home and Lock Screens with interactive widgets, and in Control Center, and you can tie Drafts to the Action button. You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to Drafts on the iPad. You can even take advantage of a new dictation model based on the speech-to-text engine that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/hands-on-how-apples-new-speech-apis-outpace-whisper-for-lightning-fast-transcription/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">released</a> this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p167\">When you combine all of these features together \u2013 the deep customization that Drafts allows and its support for new Apple frameworks \u2013 it\u2019s clear that what Greg Pierce created is no longer just a place \u201cwhere text starts\u201d. It\u2019s a place where text can evolve, where text can be processed, where text can be integrated with external services.</p>\n<p id=\"p168\">Drafts can still be, if you want, a simple notepad. And that\u2019s where the strength of the app fundamentally lies: Drafts doesn\u2019t force you to turn it into a complex Markdown text editor. Its modular architecture means that it can be one when you need it, but it also stays true to its roots of being \u201cjust\u201d a notepad when you have an idea and want to make sure that you don\u2019t lose it.</p>\n<p id=\"p169\">Drafts is the kind of app that can be something different for all kinds of different users. And it\u2019s because of its shape-shifting nature that Drafts represents the vision for what an app on Apple platforms should be in 2025. In the age of AI, Drafts still is a piece of software crafted with exquisite taste and thoughtfulness, but it\u2019s also a modular space where the boundaries of what the \u201capp\u201d should be become more blurry. It\u2019s the kind of experience that adapts to your workflow instead of forcing you to rely on someone else\u2019s \u201copinionated\u201d design.</p>\n<p id=\"p170\">Drafts is the ultimate example of what it means to combine taste, solid design principles, and the ingenuity to accept how software is changing and how a single developer who\u2019s been working on the same app for the past 13 years can still find new ways to innovate and explore the frontier of iOS automation.</p>\n<p id=\"p171\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a> by Greg Pierce is the MacStories Selects App of the Year for 2025 and, at long last, an app that has gained a permanent spot on my Home Screen.</p>\n<p id=\"p172\"><strong>Learn more about Drafts:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul173\"><li><a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"app-of-the-year-runner-up\">App of the Year Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p174\"></p><center id=\"center175\">\n<h2 id=\"athlytic-2\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_athlytic-iphone-1765459734020.png\"><p></p></div>\n<p id=\"p177\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> As I mentioned above when profiling it for Best Watch App, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a> has been flying under the radar for a few years now while steadily adding great new features. 2025 seems to have been the year it finally became a breakout hit, much to my delight. Myke Hurley on the <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected/580\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Connected</a> podcast has been singing its praises, and it even appeared in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW21q_7U6Ao&amp;pp=ygUXd2hhdHMgb24gbXkgcGhvbmUgbWtiaGTSBwkJKQoBhyohjO8%3D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MKBHD\u2019s latest \u201cWhat\u2019s on my Phone\u201d video</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p178\">There\u2019s good reason for this. Athlytic is a powerful health and fitness app, not just for people who hit the gym every day, but also for those who want to monitor their vital statistics without getting overwhelmed or having to learn a bunch of new jargon. Athlytic calls itself an \u201cAI Fitness Coach\u201d, but what it\u2019s doing under the hood is taking the many data points your Apple Watch collects and using them to track trends and form insights into your fitness levels.</p>\n<p id=\"p179\">If you\u2019re a fitness enthusiast, these insights are very powerful for planning your training and making sure you are well recovered. But if you want to simply monitor your health, Athlytic is just as useful. Sleep analysis is a particular highlight, surfacing your sleep quality, stages, duration, restorative sleep, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 sleep debt.</p>\n<p id=\"p180\">I could go on listing the many areas Athlytic covers, but what\u2019s more important is how well the app collates its data, making it digestible and accessible in a well-designed Liquid Glass UI. It even explains to you in plain English what each of its category means.</p>\n<p id=\"p181\">There are many great fitness-tracking apps on the market, but Athlytic is head and shoulders above the others in both its breadth of information and its actionable utility.</p>\n<p id=\"p182\"><strong>Learn more about Athlytic:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul183\"><li><a href=\"https://www.athlyticapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul>",

App innovation comes from many places. Sometimes it&rsquo;s new Apple APIs or hardware, and other times it&rsquo;s broader shifts in the tech world.</p>\n<aside class=\"aside aligncenter aside-narrow\" id=\"aside3\"><h3 class=\"pre-title\" id=\"supported-by\">Supported By</h3>\n<h2 id=\"revenuecat\">RevenueCat</h2>\n\n<p></p><center><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/icon-1765726239510.png\" width=\"180\" alt=\"\"></center>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/?utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_campaign=general_sponsorship&amp;utm_content=macstories-selects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer\">RevenueCat:</a></strong> The easiest way to add in-app subscriptions and native paywalls into your apps.</p>\n</aside><p id=\"p4\">Last year was <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/regulation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marked by a series of App Store changes</a> in the EU, U.S., and elsewhere that have begun to reshape the app landscape. The updates have been slow to roll out and have been met with resistance from Apple, but we&rsquo;re starting to see policy updates, like developers&rsquo; ability to offer <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/developers-and-platforms-react-as-app-store-rules-change-in-the-u-s/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">web-based purchases</a>, translate into new business models, expanding the kinds of apps that are available.</p>\n<p id=\"p5\">Political and regulatory pressures on Apple continued to affect the apps we use this year, too, but the lion&rsquo;s share of the change we saw in 2025 came from more traditional sources. This year, it was great to see a surge in app innovation sparked by <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/apple-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other AI services</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/liquid-glass/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquid Glass</a> design language, and other new APIs and features from Apple. The result has been a broad-based acceleration of app innovation that we expect to continue into 2026 and beyond. But before looking ahead to what&rsquo;s next, it&rsquo;s time to pause as we do each year to reflect on the many apps we tried in 2025 and recognize the best among them.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/group-left-close-1765746853199.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p7\">This year, the MacStories team picked the best apps in six categories:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul8\"><li>Best New App</li>\n<li>Best New Feature</li>\n<li>Best Watch App</li>\n<li>Best Mac App</li>\n<li>Best Design</li>\n<li>App of the Year</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p9\"><a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories</a>&nbsp;members were part of the selection process, too, picking the winner of the MacStories Selects Readers&rsquo; Choice Award.

One of the first utilities in this collection was Quick Reviews, a simple way to create a shareable image of a movie you&rsquo;ve watched. The image includes your review, rating, and a poster in the color scheme of your choice.</p>\n<p id=\"p22\">I really liked this utility on the desktop, but the web app was calling out for a native iOS version. This year, Matt created precisely that, alongside three other apps. (He&rsquo;s had a very busy year.) However, it&rsquo;s not just a like-for-like copy of the web version, but a fully formed mobile app that integrates both first- and third-party APIs &ndash; and one I now use shortly after the credits roll on any movie I watch.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_quick-reviews-1765459729115.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p24\">Another place movie lovers like me log what we watch is <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Letterboxd</a>, and Quick Reviews smartly integrates with the popular movie community platform to pull in your latest activity. You can, of course, create a review from scratch in Quick Reviews, but this integration is ideal for someone who wants to share their views on a movie in a visually delightful way with minimal effort, just by auto-importing a title they&rsquo;ve already logged on Letterboxd.</p>\n<p id=\"p25\">Like Matt&rsquo;s other apps, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-reviews/id6740369719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quick Reviews</a> is a simple concept that&rsquo;s well thought out and executed, making it a joy to use. It&rsquo;s now part of my movie-watching ritual, and I suspect that&rsquo;s the case for many others. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be able to name Quick Reviews the Best New App of 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"p26\"><strong>Learn more about Quick Reviews:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul27\"><li><a href=\"https://quickreviews.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-reviews/id6740369719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-new-app-runners-up\">Best New App Runners-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p28\"></p><center id=\"center29\">\n<h2 id=\"wispr-flow\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-52-20-1765817548450.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p31\"><strong>Federico:</strong> Look, I don&rsquo;t know if the issue is that I&rsquo;m becoming a worse typer or that Apple&rsquo;s software keyboard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hksVvXONrIo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has gotten progressively worse</a>, but the thing is, over the past year, I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m sending texts with more typos than ever. Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t catch those typos in time, messages are sent with them, and &ndash; if I can &ndash; I use the &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; feature in iMessage or Slack to fix them. But other times I <em>do</em> see my typos, and I spend way too much time dealing with the iPhone&rsquo;s keyboard and text cursor to fix them. It&rsquo;s exhausting. So months ago I decided to go all-in on embracing dictation as a way to write messages in Slack, Messages, and <a href=\"https://superhuman.com/products/mail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Superhuman</a>, as well as to append quick notes to my Notion, and the best app I&rsquo;ve found to do this on all my devices, but especially on iOS, is <a href=\"https://wisprflow.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p32\">Wispr Flow is part of a new wave of dictation apps that leverages LLMs under the hood to understand you in multiple languages (including a mix of languages within the same sentence), learns from you over time, and supports a custom dictionary of words to make sure that specific terms aren&rsquo;t misspelled. Wispr Flow became popular on macOS and Windows first, but a few months ago, it launched on iOS, too, with a genius implementation of AI-based dictation: the app is a custom keyboard that you can use anywhere. To make it work in the background after the first launch, the app uses a Live Activity that persists in the Dynamic Island/Lock Screen and can be terminated at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"p33\">Wispr Flow on iOS has been a game changer for me when it comes to sending long messages to my team on Slack or responding to a long iMessage thread with John. The app syncs my custom dictionary and snippets with the Mac, and the performance has been <em>outstanding</em> with my Pro account, both in terms of speed and overall accuracy. Wispr&rsquo;s dictation on iOS is leagues ahead of the experience provided by Apple &ndash; so much so that I&rsquo;ve outright disabled iOS&rsquo; default dictation and solely rely on Wispr Flow&rsquo;s now.</p>\n<p id=\"p34\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wispr Flow for iOS</a> is arguably the best third-party keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever tested, combined with two modern technologies (AI speech-to-text and Live Activities) that make it one of the most exciting app debuts on Apple platforms this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p35\"><strong>Learn more about Wispr Flow:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul36\"><li><a href=\"https://wisprflow.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wispr-flow-ai-voice-keyboard/id6497229487\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p37\"></p><center id=\"center38\">\n<h2 id=\"activas\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/activas-intelligent-wellness/id6749898750\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activas</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-19-45-43-1765241150328.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p40\"><strong>John:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/activas-modern-design-with-a-sprinkling-of-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I just reviewed Activas</a> by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@brianhough\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Hough</a> last week and can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough. Apple&rsquo;s Health app contains a wealth of information, but it&rsquo;s not always presented in the most meaningful way for users, and it rarely puts pieces of information together in a way that paints a complete picture.</p>\n<p id=\"p41\">That&rsquo;s where <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/activas-intelligent-wellness/id6749898750\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activas</a> excels. Using the same data paired with modern design and explanations generated by carefully controlled AI prompts, the app presents your health data with graphs and text that are more meaningful for someone trying to understand how their health and fitness fit together.</p>\n<p id=\"p42\">Activas shares the Health app&rsquo;s approach to privacy, too. Your data remains on your device, and the AI insights are also generated on-device. I appreciate the constrained use of AI here as well. Activas includes a chatbot, but the questions you can ask are predefined, lowering the risk of potentially harmful hallucinations. This limits what you can get out of the Activas AI feature, but it doesn&rsquo;t ruin the experience.

It&rsquo;s been a <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/210\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recurring</a> topic on <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AppStories</a>; I&rsquo;ve written up several shortcuts for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-starter-pack-reverse-engineering-the-matter-api-and-my-save-to-matter-shortcut/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories</a> and the <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/posts/importing-goodlinks-articles-into-readwise-reader-via-the-api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club</a> involving different apps; I&rsquo;ve tried my best to keep our Discord members up to date on my latest read-later workflow whenever possible. This year alone, I switched multiple times between <a href=\"https://goodlinks.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoodLinks</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Readwise Reader</a>, and <a href=\"https://web.getmatter.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matter</a>. Ultimately, though, I always went back to Matter, primarily for two reasons:</p>\n<ol id=\"ol49\"><li>I really, <em>really</em> like the people behind the app and their <a href=\"https://x.com/benspringwater/status/1874271814509379683\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stories</a>.</li>\n<li>Matter&rsquo;s <strong>text-to-speech feature</strong> for listening to articles is the best one I&rsquo;ve ever tested in 16 years of writing about apps.</li>\n</ol><p id=\"p50\">Now, unfortunately, we&rsquo;re not giving out awards to our favorite people here (but maybe we should), so I&rsquo;ll just focus on the app. Matter is an exquisitely designed read-later app for iOS, iPadOS, and the web that has wholly embraced Liquid Glass and is better because of it. Toolbars and tab bars float gracefully above text and get out of the way when not needed, putting the focus on the actual content you want to read; when they animate, they do so beautifully with liquid effects that feel right at home in iOS 26. I know that the point of a read-later app isn&rsquo;t to look pretty, but after all, we&rsquo;re all Apple users here, and if we thought about user experience like that, we would have used Linux &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t. (Shout-out to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SteamOS</a>, though.)</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-55-17-1765817734166.png\" alt=\"Listening to an article in Matter.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Listening to an article in Matter.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p52\">The fact that Matter looks great helps, but for me this year, the reason it&rsquo;s stood out among the competition has been its incredible text-to-speech functionality that lets you listen to articles and newsletters as if they were podcast episodes. I don&rsquo;t know with absolute certainty which AI provider the Matter team is using (my theory is that it&rsquo;s a non-compressed version of <a href=\"https://unrealspeech.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unreal&rsquo;s voices</a>, though I may be wrong), but we should applaud their business decision to support high-quality voices (which tend to be expensive for developers, especially when not compressed) and the UI they designed around them. Matter&rsquo;s audio player &ndash; again, <em>thanks</em> to Liquid Glass &ndash; natively docks at the bottom of the page, just like Music, when you&rsquo;re listening to a story. Tap on it, and you&rsquo;ll be presented with a full-screen audio player that includes playback controls, menus for speed and voices, and even a sleep timer.</p>\n<p id=\"p53\">I&rsquo;ve tried several read-later apps over the years, and particularly in the past year, I&rsquo;ve focused my research on finding the best-sounding AI voices for catching up on my read-later queue while I&rsquo;m doing other things throughout the day. The simple reality is that Matter&rsquo;s implementation of text-to-speech has allowed me to &ldquo;read&rdquo; more, be more informed, and stay inspired. For all these reasons, Matter&rsquo;s text-to-speech functionality is the Best New Feature for MacStories Selects 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"p54\"><strong>Learn more about Matter:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul55\"><li><a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/matter-save-read-grow/id1501592184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/matter-a-fresh-take-on-read-later-apps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-new-feature-runners-up\">Best New Feature Runners-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p56\"></p><center id=\"center57\">\n<h2 id=\"longplays-mcp-integration\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/longplay/id1495152002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay&rsquo;s MCP Integration</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-15-at-17-53-12-2x-1765817615663.png\" alt=\"Using Longplay for Mac in Claude.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Using Longplay for Mac in Claude.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p59\"><strong>Federico:</strong> <a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay</a>, created by indie developer <a href=\"https://adrian.schoenig.me\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adrian Sch&ouml;nig</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-2-0-an-album-oriented-apple-music-player-with-loads-of-new-features/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long been</a> one of our favorite companion apps for Apple Music that puts the focus on listening to albums rather than playlists or algorithmic discovery. And earlier this year, Sch&ouml;nig was one of the first developers to pioneer a new frontier for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/hybrid-automation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hybrid automation</a> in macOS apps with <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/455\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration</a> in Longplay for Mac.</p>\n<p id=\"p60\">As <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-for-mac-launches-with-powerful-ai-and-shortcuts-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John explained in our review</a> a few months ago, the MCP integration in Longplay allows you to query your Apple Music library with natural language, leveraging the processing capabilities of Claude to explore your library and control music playback in a way that isn&rsquo;t possible with Apple Music and the Music app alone. Thanks to a built-in installation flow based on the native <code>.mcpb</code> bundle format, Longplay can be added as a native connector to Claude, which gives the assistant a variety of tools to find albums and collections, play media, and control playback. In less than 30 seconds, you can enable an integration that lets you ask questions like, <em>&ldquo;Which albums have I added to my library lately?&rdquo;</em> or send commands like, <em>&ldquo;Create a collection of Oasis singles and B-sides,&rdquo;</em> and have Claude complete those requests from its chat interface. This feature is excellent, and it&rsquo;s a fantastic example of how AI can complement human creativity and music enjoyment without displacing them.</p>\n<p id=\"p61\"><a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay</a> and its MCP server for Mac played an important role in my decision to try Apple Music again after a year spent using Spotify. Exploring the nooks and crannies of my music library is an experience I&rsquo;ve never had before with any music streaming service, and as it stands right now, it&rsquo;s exclusively made possible by Longplay and Sch&ouml;nig&rsquo;s vision for a different kind of music search. If you&rsquo;re an Apple Music subscriber (or a lapsed one, like I used to be) and have Claude installed on your Mac, you owe it to yourself to play around with Longplay&rsquo;s MCP integration.</p>\n<p id=\"p62\"><strong>Learn more about Longplay:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul63\"><li><a href=\"https://longplay.rocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/longplay/id1495152002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/longplay-for-mac-launches-with-powerful-ai-and-shortcuts-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><p id=\"p64\"></p><center id=\"center65\">\n<h2 id=\"bridges-shortcuts-actions\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridges&rsquo; Shortcuts Actions</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-22-04-40-1765253103346.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p67\"><strong>Devon:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridges</a>, the app for saving, organizing, and sharing links from <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@refactoredd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jonathan Ruiz</a>, in my regular workflow for <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/magic-rays-of-light/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Rays of Light</a> for years now, and it is excellent. No other app offers both the organizational features and flexibility that Bridges does for storing links to share in podcast show notes, YouTube video descriptions, newsletters, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"p68\">If you&rsquo;re the type of person who needs a tool like Bridges, you&rsquo;re also likely someone who tends to automate their workflows as much as possible. That&rsquo;s where the app&rsquo;s Shortcuts actions, introduced this fall, come in. Bridges&rsquo; Shortcuts integration includes a comprehensive set of actions that allow you to perform all of the app&rsquo;s core functionalities &ndash; saving links, sharing folders of URLs in various formats, searching through stored links, and more &ndash; without opening the app at all. Even better, the actions are all customizable, giving you the capability to tweak them and combine them with other actions to fit your exact use cases.</p>\n<p id=\"p69\">Before it added Shortcuts actions, Bridges was already my favorite way to create show notes for the podcast; now, the app makes me feel like I have superpowers. Using a shortcut I built with Bridges&rsquo; actions, I can save a link from any app to the precise section and in the exact format that I want it in my show notes, and I&rsquo;m even able to further act on those links depending on which section I save them to, such as automatically adding a movie trailer to my queue in <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play</a>. When it comes time to actually put out an episode, a single run of another shortcut generates my show notes in the precise format I need them for publishing and clears out my saved links in preparation for the next episode.</p>\n<p id=\"p70\">Bridges&rsquo; integration with Shortcuts is an excellent example of how well-implemented automation tools can empower users to make an app their own, get things done more efficiently, and spend more time creating. It&rsquo;s a fantastic addition to an already very powerful app, and one that&rsquo;s made my life easier on a weekly basis ever since it was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"p71\"><strong>Learn more about Bridges:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul72\"><li><a href=\"https://www.bridgesapp.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bridges-link-formatting/id1661901002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-watch-app\">Best Watch App</h2>\n<p id=\"p73\"></p><center id=\"center74\">\n<h2 id=\"athlytic\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/watch-1765746852953.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p76\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a> has been on the scene for several years, and so far, it&rsquo;s flown under most people&rsquo;s radars. However, the two-person development team has continued to add value to the app at an impressive rate. It&rsquo;s a fitness app that aims to help you train smarter and learn more about your metrics, such as sleep quality, recovery, and energy levels, with easily accessible data points that are clearly laid out and explained. Athlytic touts its use of AI, but it&rsquo;s important to note that all results you are presented with, including recovery, battery, and sleep debt, are obtained by analyzing hard data from your Apple Watch.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_athlytic-watch-1765459726027.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p78\">While the iOS version is wide in scope, what&rsquo;s impressive about its watchOS counterpart is how it trims down various areas while still feeling full-featured and valuable on a day-to-day basis. Your key statistics &ndash; recovery, exertion, sleep, energy, stress, and battery &ndash; are available on the main screen for you to glance at or, with a further tap, analyze in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"p79\">You can kick off a workout from within the app without your iPhone, too. One of the frustrations of Apple&rsquo;s Fitness and Workout apps on watchOS is the limited amount of post-workout data there is for you to review. It&rsquo;s fine for casual users, but Athlytic provides so much more, and in a way that doesn&rsquo;t overwhelm you.</p>\n<p id=\"p80\">I&rsquo;ve noted Athlytic in my past two annual <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/watchos-reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watchOS reviews</a> as something Apple should take note of in its first-party efforts. If you&rsquo;re interested in delving deeper into your fitness and health statistics, Athlytic is a valuable app to have on your wrist, and it well deserves this year&rsquo;s MacStories Selects Award for Best Watch App.</p>\n<p id=\"p81\"><strong>Learn more about Athlytic:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul82\"><li><a href=\"https://www.athlyticapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-watch-app-runner-up\">Best Watch App Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p83\"></p><center id=\"center84\">\n<h2 id=\"%c2%b5browser\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&micro;Browser</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_ubrowser-1765459725303.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p86\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> The Apple Watch was never meant to be used for browsing the web. If it were, you know Apple would have built a version of Safari for watchOS. That said, one of the enormous benefits of having an Apple Watch is that it negates the need to pull your iPhone out of your pocket every time you get a message or a notification. We&rsquo;ve all fallen into that trap of checking a text only to discover we&rsquo;re suddenly ten minutes into a social media scroll.</p>\n<p id=\"p87\">This is where having a browser on your wrist like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&micro;Browser</a> (&ldquo;&micro;&rdquo; means &ldquo;micro&rdquo; in Greek) can be helpful. Typing a URL into the app &ndash; or better yet, opening a bookmark saved using its iOS version &ndash; will display a website on the small Apple Watch screen. There are limitations to what watchOS allows, so you won&rsquo;t see any flashy animations, but text-based sites work great. This is perfect for a quick check of the headlines without the danger of doomscrolling.</p>\n<p id=\"p88\">In the latest version of &micro;Browser for watchOS 26, developer <a href=\"https://mastodon.online/@arno_app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arno Appenzeller</a> has added support for the new Controls API. This puts your favorite websites just a tap away inside Control Center. &micro;Browser does one thing, and it does it well, and support for new watchOS features (not too common this year) adds a lot of value to this clever little utility.</p>\n<p id=\"p89\"><strong>Learn more about &micro;Browser:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul90\"><li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C2%B5browser-watch-web-browser/id1590622755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-mac-app\">Best Mac App</h2>\n<p id=\"p91\"></p><center id=\"center92\">\n<h2 id=\"bloom\"><strong><a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloom</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/mac-app-1765746852890.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p94\"><strong>John:</strong> Replacements for the Mac&rsquo;s Finder have been around a long time, but I never really felt the need to use one until about a year ago. Part of it was the increasing burden of managing dozens of articles and podcast production files every week, but the change was also driven by the lack of interesting Finder improvements over the past several years. As with most of the core apps I use for my work, I felt it was time to shake things up a little and see if there was something better out there. It turns out there is: <a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloom</a> by <a href=\"https://asiafu.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asia Fu</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p95\">Bloom has so many of the qualities that we love at MacStories. It&rsquo;s a native app that you&rsquo;ll feel right at home in, and it&rsquo;s actively developed with new features and refinements coming out at a remarkable clip. But best of all, it manages to tuck a lot of innovative features into a package that feels familiar, which makes it easy to get up and running fast but also do more than you can in Finder.</p>\n<p id=\"p96\">The star of the show is Bloom&rsquo;s ability to create multi-pane views. There are 12 pane configurations, ranging from a single pane that entirely fills the app&rsquo;s window to a four-pane quadrant setup. My personal favorite is a three-pane view with a bigger pane on the left and a couple of smaller ones on the right. It&rsquo;s perfect for my podcast production workflow, allowing me to put working files in the left pane and completed audio and video files in the right two panes.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-08-33-18-2x-1765632839782.png\" alt=\"A Bloom workspace I saved for producing NPC: Next Portable Console.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">A Bloom workspace I saved for producing NPC: Next Portable Console.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p98\">What&rsquo;s especially nice is that you can save pane configurations as presets that Bloom calls Workspaces. For me, that&rsquo;s meant setting up workspaces for each of the podcasts I produce. When it&rsquo;s time to start processing audio and editing, I can quickly open a window with my predefined panes from the app&rsquo;s toolbar or with a keyboard shortcut.</p>\n<p id=\"p99\">Speaking of which, Bloom allows users to define keyboard shortcuts for virtually every aspect of the app. It also supports AppleScript, so automating your workflows is relatively simple, even though the app doesn&rsquo;t support Shortcuts directly.</p>\n<p id=\"p100\">Probably the most unique feature of Bloom is the Portal, a mini window that supports most of the app&rsquo;s core features and can be pinned on top of other windows. The approach is flexible enough to allow the Portal to serve as an alternative to a shelf utility app or simply as a way to conserve screen space when you need to access files in a folder repeatedly while working in another app.</p>\n<p id=\"p101\">Search is different in Bloom than in the Finder, too, and a little hard to get used to at first. However, if you invest time in learning how it works, it pays dividends. Using a global keyboard shortcut, you can quickly jump to any folder by typing its name. It works like &lsquo;Go to Folder&rsquo; in the Finder, but from anywhere. Plus, it also handles keyword searches for files. Unlike the Finder, which defaults to searching your Mac&rsquo;s entire drive, typing &#8984;+F automatically searches the folder you&rsquo;re viewing, too. Best of all, both search methods are extremely fast.</p>\n<p id=\"p102\">Other notable features include:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul103\"><li>a built-in archive file viewer,</li>\n<li>the ability to navigate a folder in one pane while displaying its content in the pane to its right,</li>\n<li>automatic resizing of columns, making list views far more readable,</li>\n<li>a menu bar app for accessing your favorites, folders, workspaces, and locations,</li>\n<li>built-in image editing tools, and</li>\n<li>a keyboard shortcut to open the folder you are viewing in Terminal or another terminal app.</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p104\">There&rsquo;s even more to Bloom than that, which is why I haven&rsquo;t reviewed the app on MacStories before now. It&rsquo;s so deep that I still feel like I&rsquo;m discovering new ways to use it, and all the while, the developer continues to add new features. But that depth and dynamism are precisely why Bloom is our Mac App of the Year. It&rsquo;s easy to use, but built with the power user in mind, rewarding the curious with thoughtful and unique ways to manage your files.</p>\n<p id=\"p105\"><strong>Learn more about Bloom:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul106\"><li><a href=\"https://bloomapp.club\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/461\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AppStories, Episode 461: Our Latest App and Automation Experiments</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-mac-app-runner-up\">Best Mac App Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p107\"></p><center id=\"center108\">\n<h2 id=\"supercharge\"><strong><a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supercharge</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-09-19-37-2x-1765635670180.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p110\"><strong>John:</strong> <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sindre Sorhus</a> has a lot of apps on the App Store for all of Apple&rsquo;s platforms, and I use many of them. Some are simple utilities that do one thing well, like <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/week-number\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Week Number</a> putting the week number in your Mac&rsquo;s menu bar. <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supercharge</a> is a menu bar app, too, but it&rsquo;s different because it collects a wide variety of utilities under one icon.</p>\n<p id=\"p111\">The kinds of tools and tweaks you&rsquo;ll find in Supercharge are often available other ways but are buried deep in System Settings or require a trip to the Terminal. With Supercharge, not only can you access all these tools in one central location, but you can also set keyboard shortcuts for each, and the app comes with an extensive collection of Shortcuts actions.</p>\n<p id=\"p112\">Supercharge includes ways to:</p>\n<ul id=\"ul113\"><li>manage windows and notifications,</li>\n<li>eject drives, </li>\n<li>set light, dark, and other modes, </li>\n<li>sleep your displays,</li>\n<li>mute your Mac&rsquo;s microphone,</li>\n<li>and much more.</li>\n</ul><p id=\"p114\">Besides the actions available in the menu bar, there are many more tweaks available in Supercharge&rsquo;s settings that alter the Dock and how windows, apps, the menu bar, the Finder, and Mission Control work. Plus, the app installs a long list of services that add actions that can be taken on folders and files with a right-click, including &lsquo;AirDrop&rsquo;, &lsquo;Copy Path&rsquo;, &lsquo;Move to&hellip;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Copy to&hellip;&rsquo;, &lsquo;Toggle Hidden Files&rsquo;, and more. Supercharge also includes a built-in utility to debug keyboard shortcut conflicts, which I greatly appreciate because new apps I install are forever colliding with other apps and shortcuts I&rsquo;ve created.</p>\n<p id=\"p115\">Ultimately, though, Supercharge&rsquo;s utility isn&rsquo;t any one of its features; it&rsquo;s the collection itself that brings disparate functionality together under one easily accessible roof. It&rsquo;s also the kind of app where it pays off to scroll through its actions and various tweaks now and then. There are so many that they&rsquo;re hard to absorb in one sitting. Instead, by revisiting the app periodically, you&rsquo;ll discover new things to add to your toolbox as your workflows evolve.</p>\n<p id=\"p116\"><strong>Learn more about Supercharge:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul117\"><li><a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1749879483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comfort Zone, Episode 48: Raycast Does This</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1749879483\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comfort Zone, Episode 42: Should We Do a Conclave?</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"best-design\">Best Design</h2>\n<p id=\"p118\"></p><center id=\"center119\">\n<h2 id=\"sequel\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequel</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/design-1765746855569.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p121\"><strong>Devon:</strong> MacStories readers will no doubt recognize <a href=\"https://mastodon.design/@rlfb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Romain Lefebvre</a>&rsquo;s media tracker <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sequel</a> from past editions of the MacStories Selects Awards. The app took home <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-app-update\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best App Update in 2023</a> and was a runner up for both <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2024-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-new-feature-runners-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best New Feature</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2024-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#readers-choice-runner-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Readers&rsquo; Choice Award</a> last year. This year, the app has won Best Design, and if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to its development this fall, you already know why.</p>\n<p id=\"p122\">Sequel has been through a lot of changes over its lifespan, but one thing it&rsquo;s always been great at is applying the latest available technologies to the challenge of media tracking in a way that benefits users. We saw this last year with <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-3s-magic-lookup-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-apps-should-integrate-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Magic Lookup&rsquo;s practical application of AI</a>, and it&rsquo;s happened again this year with Sequel&rsquo;s implementation of Liquid Glass. Lefebvre has not only applied Liquid Glass in a way that complements Sequel&rsquo;s distinctive look while keeping it in step with Apple&rsquo;s latest design standards, but he&rsquo;s also taken it as an opportunity to rethink the app&rsquo;s navigation on iPhone and deliver a much-requested feature: universal search.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-08-dec-2025-22-07-13-1765253250756.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p124\">As <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/3/#buttons-toolbars-and-tab-bars\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federico pointed out in his review of iOS 26</a>, Sequel on the iPhone is taking advantage of the fact that Liquid Glass makes tab bars for apps with simple navigation much more attractive than before. The app&rsquo;s two navigation tabs, Saved and Collections, house the majority of its functionality and make it really simple to switch between the two. I&rsquo;ve certainly found myself taking advantage of the Collections feature more often now that it&rsquo;s readily available from anywhere in the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p125\">Also now available from anywhere is search, the app&rsquo;s third navigation button residing in the bottom-right corner of the iPhone UI. In Liquid Glass fashion, the button expands upon being pressed into a search bar that allows you to look for content across media types. Not only is the search feature more easy to access with this design, but it&rsquo;s also more complete, incorporating search from within the user&rsquo;s libraries and from Sequel&rsquo;s databases in one set of results &ndash; capabilities that used to be found in separate parts of the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p126\">Of course, Sequel users on other platforms benefit from these changes, too. Universal search is available via the sidebar on iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro, where the app&rsquo;s libraries and collections also reside. Buttons and menus throughout the app have been redesigned with Liquid Glass as well, and every version of Sequel features a gorgeous new media detail view with header images that morph seamlessly into blurred backgrounds as you scroll.</p>\n<p id=\"p127\">Put all of this together, and you&rsquo;ve got a design that&rsquo;s modern, fluid, and functional while still letting your content and artwork take center stage. Sequel&rsquo;s design has always stood out as admirable, considered, and self-assured. Now, it&rsquo;s award-worthy.</p>\n<p id=\"p128\"><strong>Learn more about Sequel:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul129\"><li><a href=\"https://www.getsequel.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sequel-media-tracker/id1630746993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/sequel-2-0-an-iphone-and-ipad-media-tracker-that-strikes-an-elegant-balance-between-form-and-function/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"best-design-runner-up\">Best Design Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p130\"></p><center id=\"center131\">\n<h2 id=\"not-boring-camera\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(Not Boring) Camera</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_not-boring-camera-1765459732299.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p133\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> No design can please everyone, but it&rsquo;s frustrating when app developers consider design far down on their list of priorities. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s great to see apps take big swings with bold, unique designs. This is precisely the mentality that <a href=\"https://notbor.ing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Not Boring Software</a> has been following for the past few years, and it continues with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(Not Boring) Camera</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p134\">(Not Boring) Camera is the closest you&rsquo;ll get to the feel of a real camera on a flat screen. One of its key features is a massively customizable &ldquo;outer case&rdquo;, which you can configure with a selection of color scheme presets or a color scheme you define yourself. Once you&rsquo;ve chosen your colors, you can go ahead and start taking pictures. The app uses animations and haptics to enhance the experience even more, fooling you into thinking &ndash; if just for a moment &ndash; that you&rsquo;re using a real camera.</p>\n<p id=\"p135\">Thankfully, the app&rsquo;s appeal doesn&rsquo;t end with visual customization. (Not Boring) Camera uses styles to directly manipulate your photos as you take them. You can even import your own custom <a href=\"https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-lut/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LUTs</a> for a really pro-level finish, and the developers have collaborated with photographers to create original styles for the app.</p>\n<p id=\"p136\">All of this custom photography is easily accessible via a chunky UI, making shooting easy. No more fiddly dials or switches; the design is both aesthetic and functional.</p>\n<p id=\"p137\">(Not Boring) Camera is a pro-level camera app that combines fun with a genuine love and knowledge of photography. Even if you&rsquo;re not a photographer, you&rsquo;ll want to keep coming back for the delight you get when using this unique app design.</p>\n<p id=\"p138\"><strong>Learn more about (Not Boring) Camera:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul139\"><li><a href=\"https://notbor.ing/product/camera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-camera/id6737783441\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/posts/not-boring-camera\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories Coverage</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"readers-choice-award\">Readers&rsquo; Choice Award</h2>\n<p id=\"p140\"></p><center id=\"center141\">\n<h2 id=\"alfred\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alfred</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/readers-choice-1765746855602.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p143\"><strong>John:</strong> I enjoy the Readers&rsquo; Choice selection process every year. We start by asking <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the full Club MacStories membership</a> to nominate their favorite apps of the year. Then, <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/plans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plus and Premier members</a> vote on the nominees. The fun part is seeing what apps have readers&rsquo; mindshare as the nominations and votes come in.</p>\n<p id=\"p144\">This year was a little different than most. Often, readers choose an app that was released in the last year or two, which makes sense; MacStories readers love to try new apps. But every so often, the stars align and a classic app that&rsquo;s been around for a long time recaptures the imaginations of readers. This year, that app is <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alfred</a> by <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Running with Crayons</a>, which Club MacStories readers picked for this year&rsquo;s Readers&rsquo; Choice Award.</p>\n<p id=\"p145\">Alfred&rsquo;s history stretches back to 2010 when <a href=\"https://qsapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QuickSilver</a>, arguably the spark that started the entire launcher app category, began to fade as its development was open-sourced and slowed. In the years since, Alfred has been one of the pillars of the launcher category because it can do so much more than just launch apps. Other apps came and went, but Alfred has continued to evolve and remains a core must-have utility for a legion of Mac users.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-12-13-at-09-17-59-2x-1765635501240.png\" alt=\"Alfred is highly customizable.\"><p class=\"image-caption\">Alfred is highly customizable.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p147\">Alfred is an excellent pick for the Readers&rsquo; Choice Award in any year, but I suspect it was <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-26-tahoe-the-macstories-review/3/#spotlight\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple&rsquo;s expansion of Spotlight</a> in macOS Tahoe that recaptured Mac users&rsquo; imaginations. Spotlight&rsquo;s updates in macOS Tahoe are excellent, but as with any system feature, an alternative like Alfred does so much more. Apple undoubtedly brought more people to the launcher category and reminded others of the value of third-party apps that offer even more.</p>\n<p id=\"p148\">What I love about the launcher category is that these apps start with the simple idea of invoking a hotkey to take actions on your Mac. But that&rsquo;s where the differences start to multiply. Sure, you can search for folders and files, launch an app or shortcut, and manage your clipboard in any of them. However, with Alfred, you also get a powerful in-app automation system that can do things that are difficult or impossible to accomplish in Shortcuts. Plus, its keyboard-driven approach to productivity is more intuitive and thoughtful than most launchers I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>\n<p id=\"p149\">I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of what Alfred can do, but what makes it special isn&rsquo;t a list of features. What sets Alfred apart is that it can be whatever its users want to make of it. If all you want to do is launch apps with Alfred, you can do that, but if you want to use it to launch scripts in the Terminal or create complex workflows, you can do that, too. It&rsquo;s an app that can grow with you as your own work evolves, and it comes with <a href=\"https://www.alfredforum.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a built-in, active community</a> that has created all sorts of automations you can install and start using without ever dipping into workflows yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"p150\">It&rsquo;s easy to see why Alfred is the 2025 MacStories Selects Readers&rsquo; Choice Award winner. It&rsquo;s a time-tested, feature-rich utility with a keyboard-driven approach to computing that taps into the power of the Mac and makes it more accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"p151\"><strong>Learn more about Alfred:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul152\"><li><a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/accessing-shortcuts-for-mac-with-alfred-workflows-and-universal-actions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accessing Shortcuts for Mac with Alfred Workflows and Universal Actions</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"app-of-the-year\">App of the Year</h2>\n<p id=\"p153\"></p><center id=\"center154\">\n<h2 id=\"drafts\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/app-of-the-year-1765746852457.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p156\"><strong>Federico:</strong> 2025 has been the year that <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a>, the excellent text editor by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@agiletortoise\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greg Pierce</a>, finally clicked for me. I know it sounds ironic given that I first reviewed Drafts <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all the way back in 2012</a> when it started as a simple scratchpad for jotting down quick ideas in plain text and sending them to a few compatible extensions. 13 years later, however, the combination of Drafts&rsquo; unrelenting evolution, Greg Pierce&rsquo;s support for the app over the years, and its constant embrace of new Apple technologies have made this app one of the essential tools in my daily workflow on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>\n<p id=\"p157\">What&rsquo;s different for Drafts in 2025 is its unique mix of traditional scripting techniques, native app integrations, and the assistance of AI and LLMs to create even <em>more</em> actions you can use in the app. For the first time in years, I realized not only that could I use Drafts as a simple notepad for jotting down random ideas and bits of text or URLs, but also that I could transform it into a powerful text editor &ndash; sort of reminiscent of Obsidian &ndash; with custom actions tailored for me, which <a href=\"https://appstories.net/episodes/464\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I vibe-coded using Claude</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p158\">This all started months ago, when I realized that modern LLMs are pretty good at writing JavaScript code and integrating with external web APIs. Drafts has long supported custom JS actions, including the ones based on <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/scripting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a JavaScript library created by Greg Pierce himself</a> specifically for the app.</p>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-50-27-1765817438693.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p160\">Years ago, I did try to learn my way around JavaScript. We&rsquo;re talking before AI, before LLMs, when I attempted to piece together custom actions based on JavaScript by Googling around or copying and pasting code that I didn&rsquo;t even understand from StackOverflow, Reddit, and forums on the Internet. I remember that I put together some pretty useful actions back in the day, and that showed me the potential for turning Drafts into a highly customizable, powerful text editor with my own actions and custom UIs. This year, however, I realized that I could just use Claude to take that idea to the next level.</p>\n<p id=\"p161\">Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve created a series of actions by prompting Claude, transforming Drafts from a relatively simple utility into the native equivalent of Obsidian: an app that&rsquo;s deeply integrated with iOS, Liquid Glass, Apple dictation, and native UI elements, but also one that is powered by custom actions for Notion, Todoist, Markdown processing, and all the other services that I use on a daily basis. After months of iteration, the result is something unique in the app landscape on iOS: a text editor that doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice native compatibility with the latest Apple APIs in favor of customization, but instead offers a customizable text environment that is <em>always</em> integrated with all of the latest technologies that Apple rolls out every September.</p>\n<p id=\"p162\">It also helps that Drafts was, of course, updated on day one for Liquid Glass, iPadOS 26, and the new APIs in the 26 family of OSes that Apple launched a few months ago. You can find Drafts in Shortcuts, on the Home and Lock Screens with interactive widgets, and in Control Center, and you can tie Drafts to the Action button. You can assign custom keyboard shortcuts to Drafts on the iPad. You can even take advantage of a new dictation model based on the speech-to-text engine that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/hands-on-how-apples-new-speech-apis-outpace-whisper-for-lightning-fast-transcription/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">released</a> this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p163\">When you combine all of these features together &ndash; the deep customization that Drafts allows and its support for new Apple frameworks &ndash; it&rsquo;s clear that what Greg Pierce created is no longer just a place &ldquo;where text starts&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a place where text can evolve, where text can be processed, where text can be integrated with external services.</p>\n<p id=\"p164\">Drafts can still be, if you want, a simple notepad. And that&rsquo;s where the strength of the app fundamentally lies: Drafts doesn&rsquo;t force you to turn it into a complex Markdown text editor. Its modular architecture means that it can be one when you need it, but it also stays true to its roots of being &ldquo;just&rdquo; a notepad when you have an idea and want to make sure that you don&rsquo;t lose it.</p>\n<p id=\"p165\">Drafts is the kind of app that can be something different for all kinds of different users. And it&rsquo;s because of its shape-shifting nature that Drafts represents the vision for what an app on Apple platforms should be in 2025. In the age of AI, Drafts still is a piece of software crafted with exquisite taste and thoughtfulness, but it&rsquo;s also a modular space where the boundaries of what the &ldquo;app&rdquo; should be become more blurry. It&rsquo;s the kind of experience that adapts to your workflow instead of forcing you to rely on someone else&rsquo;s &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; design.</p>\n<p id=\"p166\">Drafts is the ultimate example of what it means to combine taste, solid design principles, and the ingenuity to accept how software is changing and how a single developer who&rsquo;s been working on the same app for the past 13 years can still find new ways to innovate and explore the frontier of iOS automation.</p>\n<p id=\"p167\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drafts</a> by Greg Pierce is the MacStories Selects App of the Year for 2025 and, at long last, an app that has gained a permanent spot on my Home Screen.</p>\n<p id=\"p168\"><strong>Learn more about Drafts:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul169\"><li><a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"app-of-the-year-runner-up\">App of the Year Runner-Up</h3>\n<p id=\"p170\"></p><center id=\"center171\">\n<h2 id=\"athlytic-2\"><strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a></strong></h2>\n<p></p></center>\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/macstories-selects-2025_athlytic-iphone-1765459734020.png\" alt=\"\"><p class=\"image-caption\"></p></div>\n<p id=\"p173\"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> As I mentioned above when profiling it for Best Watch App, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athlytic</a> has been flying under the radar for a few years now while steadily adding great new features. 2025 seems to have been the year it finally became a breakout hit, much to my delight. Myke Hurley on the <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/connected/580\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Connected</a> podcast has been singing its praises, and it even appeared in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW21q_7U6Ao&amp;pp=ygUXd2hhdHMgb24gbXkgcGhvbmUgbWtiaGTSBwkJKQoBhyohjO8%3D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MKBHD&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on my Phone&rdquo; video</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"p174\">There&rsquo;s good reason for this. Athlytic is a powerful health and fitness app, not just for people who hit the gym every day, but also for those who want to monitor their vital statistics without getting overwhelmed or having to learn a bunch of new jargon. Athlytic calls itself an &ldquo;AI Fitness Coach&rdquo;, but what it&rsquo;s doing under the hood is taking the many data points your Apple Watch collects and using them to track trends and form insights into your fitness levels.</p>\n<p id=\"p175\">If you&rsquo;re a fitness enthusiast, these insights are very powerful for planning your training and making sure you are well recovered. But if you want to simply monitor your health, Athlytic is just as useful. Sleep analysis is a particular highlight, surfacing your sleep quality, stages, duration, restorative sleep, and &ndash; crucially &ndash; sleep debt.</p>\n<p id=\"p176\">I could go on listing the many areas Athlytic covers, but what&rsquo;s more important is how well the app collates its data, making it digestible and accessible in a well-designed Liquid Glass UI. It even explains to you in plain English what each of its category means.</p>\n<p id=\"p177\">There are many great fitness-tracking apps on the market, but Athlytic is head and shoulders above the others in both its breadth of information and its actionable utility.</p>\n<p id=\"p178\"><strong>Learn more about Athlytic:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul179\"><li><a href=\"https://www.athlyticapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/athlytic-ai-fitness-coach/id1543571755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Apps that promised to revolutionize a particular segment of the App Store were eventually acquired, discontinued, or simply abandoned. It\u2019s been <em>very</em> unusual to witness an indie app survive in a highly competitive marketplace, let alone to find one that <em>thrived</em> after having been sold twice to different owners over the years. But such is the case of <a href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unread</a>, the RSS client now developed by <a href=\"https://iosdev.space/@johnbrayton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Brayton</a> of Golden Hill Software and the recipient of this year\u2019s MacStories Selects <strong>Lifetime Achievement Award</strong>.</p>\n<aside id=\"aside5\"><h3 id=\"supported-by\">Supported By</h3>\n<h2 id=\"revenuecat\">RevenueCat</h2>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/icon-1765726239510.png\" width=\"180\"></center>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/?utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_campaign=general_sponsorship&amp;utm_content=macstories-selects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer\">RevenueCat:</a></strong> The easiest way to add in-app subscriptions and native paywalls into your apps.</p>\n</aside><p id=\"p6\">Unread was originally created by indie developer <a href=\"https://jaredsinclair.com/apps.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jared Sinclair</a> in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/supertop-buys-unread/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sold to Supertop</a> (at the time, the makers of <a href=\"https://castro.fm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Castro</a>), and then <a href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2017/08/golden-hill-software-acquires-unread/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sold again to Golden Hill Software in 2017</a>. When it first came out in 2014, Unread entered a crowded space: in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Reader\u2019s demise in 2013</a>, third-party companies and developers rushed to offer comparable RSS syncing services and compatible apps to let users sync their RSS subscriptions and read articles across multiple devices.</p>\n<p id=\"p7\">In <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/unread-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my original review from 2014</a>, I noted how Unread set a new standard for elegant, gesture-driven interfaces optimized for phones that were getting progressively larger and harder to operate with one hand. With a fluid and minimal interface driven by \u201c<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/sloppy-swiping/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sloppy gestures</a>\u201d that didn\u2019t require precision or specific buttons, Unread stood out because it followed Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/living-with-ios-7/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">then-new</a> \u201cflat design\u201d but imbued it with personality in the form of typographic choices, colors, share options (Sinclair created <a href=\"https://github.com/overshare/overshare-kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a custom share sheet</a> before an official one even <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-changed-how-i-work-on-my-iphone-and-ipad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">existed</a>), and a novel interaction mechanism for an RSS reader.</p>\n<p id=\"p8\">After a three-year stint as a Supertop product, Unread was taken under the wing of John Brayton, who did something exceptionally rare: instead of following short-lived industry trends and fads, he doubled down on Unread\u2019s essence while judiciously embracing modern technologies. Eleven years after its inception and eight years after its second sale to a different developer, Unread still stands out in the third-party indie app market because it\u2019s managed to honor its lineage while adapting to the ever-changing nature of the Apple ecosystem.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-dec-2025-17-56-45-1765817819125.png\" alt=\"Unread for iOS.\"><p>Unread for iOS.</p></div>\n<p id=\"p10\">Unread still is, at a fundamental level, an elegant and polished RSS client that syncs with multiple services and presents articles in a minimal, clutter-free UI that you can easily control with your thumb. Everything else around it, however, has evolved and expanded. Unread is now available on the iPad and Mac, where it supports features such as menu bar commands, windowing, and keyboard shortcuts. There is an Unread Cloud syncing service that is fully managed by its developer. Last year, Brayton shipped an incredibly powerful and custom Shortcuts integration that lets you trigger automations in the Shortcuts app <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-feature-from-10-years-ago-is-back-with-a-twist-in-my-favorite-rss-client/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from individual articles in Unread</a>. This year, Brayton adapted to another new reality of the modern web: Unread can now securely store <a href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2025/07/unread-45-adds-support-for-paywalled-articles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">logins for paywalled websites</a> \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Club MacStories</a> \u2013 so that all your articles that require a subscription to be read can be saved and accessed within the app. And in all of this, the modern Unread is both unmistakably the \u201csame\u201d app from 11 years ago, but also something far greater that has built upon Sinclair\u2019s original idea thanks to the constant, relentless work of its current developer, John Brayton.</p>\n<p id=\"p11\">If you\u2019ve been reading MacStories all these years, you know that this is no easy feat. Most app acquisitions don\u2019t work out in the end, leaving users with the bittersweet nostalgia of something that used to be great and was eventually swallowed up by the greater scheme of economic factors, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/app-preservation-saving-the-app-stores-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app rot</a>, technical debt, and App Store changes.</p>\n<p id=\"p12\">Against all odds, <a href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unread</a> has successfully bucked that trend and evolved into a mature, powerful product that continues to stand alone in the sea of RSS clients as a beacon of hope for indie developers and our community as a whole. There is nothing else like it. For all these reasons, we couldn\u2019t think of an app more worthy of the MacStories Selects Lifetime Achievement Award in 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"p13\"><strong>Learn more about Unread:</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"ul14\"><li><a href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id1363637349\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">App Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/unread-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MacStories Review</a></li>\n</ul>",
