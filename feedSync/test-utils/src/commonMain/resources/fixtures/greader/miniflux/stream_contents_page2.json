The ‌MacBook Air‌ has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook will likely be slightly smaller. It\u0026#39;s sounding like it won\u0026#39;t be too far off from the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, though.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThere are no details on how thick it might be, but Apple probably won\u0026#39;t prioritize a thin design for a machine optimized for a low price, even though some people are hoping that it will also be ultra thin. Ultra thin usually means more engineering work and higher-cost components for the display and other parts, but it can also sometimes be achieved by removing features. A thinner enclosure isn\u0026#39;t entirely out of the question if Apple cuts features to reduce costs, but at the same time, reducing size leads to lower battery life, and Apple probably wants to have decent battery to compete with or outmatch cheap Windows laptops.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSince the ‌MacBook Air‌ can run fine with an M-series chip and no fan in an enclosure that\u0026#39;s 0.44 inches thick, there\u0026#39;s no real reason for the MacBook to be any thicker than that, unless Apple wants to add a bigger battery.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDesign and Display\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe low-cost MacBook will have a standard LCD display with no mini-LED technology or ProMotion refresh rate. It won\u0026#39;t be able to compete with higher-end laptops in terms of brightness or HDR support.

The ‌MacBook Air‌ has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook will likely be slightly smaller. It\u0026#39;s sounding like it won\u0026#39;t be too far off from the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, though.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThere are no details on how thick it might be, but Apple probably won\u0026#39;t prioritize a thin design for a machine optimized for a low price, even though some people are hoping that it will also be ultra thin. Ultra thin usually means more engineering work and higher-cost components for the display and other parts, but it can also sometimes be achieved by removing features. A thinner enclosure isn\u0026#39;t entirely out of the question if Apple cuts features to reduce costs, but at the same time, reducing size leads to lower battery life, and Apple probably wants to have decent battery to compete with or outmatch cheap Windows laptops.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSince the ‌MacBook Air‌ can run fine with an M-series chip and no fan in an enclosure that\u0026#39;s 0.44 inches thick, there\u0026#39;s no real reason for the MacBook to be any thicker than that, unless Apple wants to add a bigger battery.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDesign and Display\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe low-cost MacBook will have a standard LCD display with no mini-LED technology or ProMotion refresh rate.

Il \u003cstrong\u003e14-27\u003c/strong\u003e del primo riposo sembra il preludio alla serata trionfale dei milanesi ma nel secondo periodo \u003cstrong\u003eHackett dà la scossa \u003c/strong\u003ein primis a livello emotivo e la gara cambia improvvisamente. \u003cstrong\u003eLe V Nere risalgono dal -15\u003c/strong\u003e in un amen, così si torna negli spogliatoi in perfetta parità a quota 47.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa musica non cambia nella terza frazione con \u003cstrong\u003eAlston, Morgan e Taylor che fanno sprofondare fino al -15 un’abulica Milano\u003c/strong\u003e. L’Olimpia dà solo timidi segnali di ripresa ma di fatto resta in balia di una \u003cstrong\u003eVirtus infinitamente più energica\u003c/strong\u003e. Una serata da sogno per i felsinei, più forti delle assenze contro una \u003cstrong\u003eEA7 che torna per un giorno la vecchia versione di sé stessa\u003c/strong\u003e: incapace di trovare una scintilla o di sfruttare gli evidenti vantaggi sotto canestro, con i vari Guduric e Brown apparsi in netta difficoltà di fronte alla freschezza dei pari ruolo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTABELLINI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirtus\u003c/strong\u003e: Vildoza 10, Pajola 4, Niang 11, Accorsi, Taylor 4, Alston 20, Canka n.e., Hackett 8, Morgan 22, Jallow 12, Akele 6.

Small packs of young men seemed to be wandering from street corner to street corner, lighting off an endless supply of fireworks, often at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne group set a lone Christmas tree ablaze and I debated suggesting they also arson the two mattresses that had been abandoned nearby over a month earlier — at least they’d then be gone. A man a few meters away tagged a white building with black spray paint — his buddy filmed using a mobile phone and video light. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet another drunken group sang some anthem (football?) and I wondered if wandering so far from my building was a good idea. But I also wondered who thinks this is really the way to celebrate the new year — we used to head down onto the street at midnight with our little kids, a handful of fireworks and a bottle of \u003cem\u003eRotkäppchen\u003c/em\u003e champagne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’d laugh with our neighbors — even the AfD voters from next door — and then go to bed.

Small packs of young men seemed to be wandering from street corner to street corner, lighting off an endless supply of fireworks, often at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne group set a lone Christmas tree ablaze and I debated suggesting they also arson the two mattresses that had been abandoned nearby over a month earlier — at least they’d then be gone. A man a few meters away tagged a white building with black spray paint — his buddy filmed using a mobile phone and video light. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet another drunken group sang some anthem (football?) and I wondered if wandering so far from my building was a good idea. But I also wondered who thinks this is really the way to celebrate the new year — we used to head down onto the street at midnight with our little kids, a handful of fireworks and a bottle of \u003cem\u003eRotkäppchen\u003c/em\u003e champagne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’d laugh with our neighbors — even the AfD voters from next door — and then go to bed. Now it felt like I was risking a trip to the hospital by just stepping out the front door. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, may you be able to keep your New Year’s resolutions for more than just a day or two — I’m hoping this snow lasts at least that long. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave a good weekend!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAndrew\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWe’re losing the 20% to Germany!\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eLandesamt für Einwanderung\u003c/em\u003e (the \u003cem\u003eAusländerbehörde\u003c/em\u003e to you and me) naturalized \u003cstrong\u003enearly 38,000 new Germans by mid-December\u003c/strong\u003e and hopes to naturalize a total 39,500 this year thanks to the new centralized, digital citizenship office, \u003ca href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/immense-steigerungen-fast-38000-einburgerungen-in-berlin-bis-mitte-dezember-15087158.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaccording to Tagesspiege\u003c/a\u003el.

Their four limbs and tail all contact the ground at slow speeds, while they use a hopping gait at higher speeds. Typically, high-speed movements are more energy-intensive than slow-speed motion, but the opposite is true for macropods like kangaroos; somehow the hopping speed and energy cost become uncoupled.

With an updated process, the A20 chip could be up to 15 percent faster than the A19, and up to 30 percent more power efficient, perhaps leading to battery life improvements. Apple is also rumored to be implementing a new packaging technology (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module, WL-MCM).\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple currently uses an SoC that integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, and other supporting components like the Image Signal Processor onto a single die, but RAM is a separate chip that\u0026#39;s stacked on top of the SoC during the packaging process. If the A20 is upgraded with WL-MCM technology, RAM will be added at the wafer level (before the wafer is cut into chips) instead of the packaging level (after the wafer is cut), reducing interconnect delays.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nWith WL-MCM, RAM is more closely integrated with the other chip components, improving memory bandwidth, reducing latency, and boosting efficiency.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro models will continue to feature a triple-lens rear camera setup with Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto lenses, but the main wide-angle lens could get an upgrade. Rumors suggest Apple will add a variable aperture, which would allow users to control the amount of light that\u0026#39;s hitting the lens for better performance in low lighting conditions and more control over depth of field. All prior iPhones have had fixed apertures.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple might tweak the Camera Control button, eliminating the swipe-based touch gestures and the haptic feedback. It is easy to accidentally change image parameters when taking a photo because of the Camera Control button\u0026#39;s swipe controls.

If the A20 is upgraded with WL-MCM technology, RAM will be added at the wafer level (before the wafer is cut into chips) instead of the packaging level (after the wafer is cut), reducing interconnect delays.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nWith WL-MCM, RAM is more closely integrated with the other chip components, improving memory bandwidth, reducing latency, and boosting efficiency.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro models will continue to feature a triple-lens rear camera setup with Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto lenses, but the main wide-angle lens could get an upgrade.

We haven\u0026#39;t heard rumors that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, but we also haven\u0026#39;t heard rumors that it won\u0026#39;t.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n‌Apple Pencil‌ support could be useful for quick note taking, sketches, signing documents, editing photos and videos, and more. Steve Jobs famously said \u0026#34;Nobody wants a stylus,\u0026#34; but in the years since he touted the ergonomics of the finger, the stylus has evolved. The ‌Apple Pencil‌ isn\u0026#39;t one of the tiny plastic pens or imprecise rubber-tipped styluses that were around back in 2007 when Jobs commented on them. It\u0026#39;s a writing implement that accurately mimics a pen or a pencil, and it feels natural to use.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSamsung\u0026#39;s foldables supported the optional S Pen for many years, but the latest Galaxy Z Fold7 dropped the feature for a thinner and lighter design, which might not bode well for Apple offering the functionality. Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is going to be somewhere around 4.5mm thick when unfolded, which will make it thinner than Apple\u0026#39;s 5.1mm \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPad Pro\u003c/a\u003e, the thinnest Apple device to date.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSome dedicated Samsung Galaxy Fold users are \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1lvjoae/samsung_dropped_s_pen_support_on_the_galaxy_z/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunhappy with the feature\u0026#39;s removal\u003c/a\u003e, so there are definitely foldable smartphone customers out there who like the flexibility of being able to use a stylus. Rumors suggest that Samsung is considering bringing S Pen support back to the next-generation Galaxy Fold, which will, coincidentally, have a shorter, wider design \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/samsung-wide-fold-device/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eto match the iPhone Fold\u003c/a\u003e. If Apple implements ‌Apple Pencil‌ support and Samsung doesn\u0026#39;t, it\u0026#39;s possible Apple will draw some switchers who don\u0026#39;t want to use a foldable without a pen option. The opposite is also a possibility, so Apple could lose customers who don\u0026#39;t want a foldable without a pen.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nGoogle didn\u0026#39;t design a stylus for the Pixel Fold, but it did implement support for the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), so the device works with third-party USI pens. USI pens don\u0026#39;t have the same functionality as the ‌Apple Pencil‌, lacking features like pressure sensitivity, but the basic stylus functionality is there for those who want it.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple could do something similar to Google. Add support for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ for those who want it, without making it a primary marketing point. That would make the ‌Apple Pencil‌ available for those who want the extra functionality, but it wouldn\u0026#39;t be a necessity. Apple could also design an ‌iPhone‌ Fold-specific ‌Apple Pencil‌ that is sized to the device and able to be charged with it, but it all depends on how Apple wants to market the ‌iPhone‌ Fold.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf it\u0026#39;s marketed as an ‌iPhone‌, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support is unlikely. Apple has long championed a touch-first approach, and no ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for the ‌iPhone‌ clearly separates it from the ‌iPad‌. If it\u0026#39;s marketed as an ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ hybrid device, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support seems like more of a possibility.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple might not be able to implement ‌Apple Pencil‌ support at all because of technical limitations. Rumors suggest that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is so thin that it doesn\u0026#39;t have the space for the TrueDepth camera hardware for \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFace ID\u003c/a\u003e, so Apple is instead adding a \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTouch ID\u003c/a\u003e button to the device. With space at such a premium, a digitizer layer for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ is probably impossible.

We haven\u0026#39;t heard rumors that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold will work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, but we also haven\u0026#39;t heard rumors that it won\u0026#39;t.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n‌Apple Pencil‌ support could be useful for quick note taking, sketches, signing documents, editing photos and videos, and more. Steve Jobs famously said \u0026#34;Nobody wants a stylus,\u0026#34; but in the years since he touted the ergonomics of the finger, the stylus has evolved. The ‌Apple Pencil‌ isn\u0026#39;t one of the tiny plastic pens or imprecise rubber-tipped styluses that were around back in 2007 when Jobs commented on them. It\u0026#39;s a writing implement that accurately mimics a pen or a pencil, and it feels natural to use.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSamsung\u0026#39;s foldables supported the optional S Pen for many years, but the latest Galaxy Z Fold7 dropped the feature for a thinner and lighter design, which might not bode well for Apple offering the functionality. Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is going to be somewhere around 4.5mm thick when unfolded, which will make it thinner than Apple\u0026#39;s 5.1mm \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPad Pro\u003c/a\u003e, the thinnest Apple device to date.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSome dedicated Samsung Galaxy Fold users are \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1lvjoae/samsung_dropped_s_pen_support_on_the_galaxy_z/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunhappy with the feature\u0026#39;s removal\u003c/a\u003e, so there are definitely foldable smartphone customers out there who like the flexibility of being able to use a stylus. Rumors suggest that Samsung is considering bringing S Pen support back to the next-generation Galaxy Fold, which will, coincidentally, have a shorter, wider design \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/samsung-wide-fold-device/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eto match the iPhone Fold\u003c/a\u003e. If Apple implements ‌Apple Pencil‌ support and Samsung doesn\u0026#39;t, it\u0026#39;s possible Apple will draw some switchers who don\u0026#39;t want to use a foldable without a pen option. The opposite is also a possibility, so Apple could lose customers who don\u0026#39;t want a foldable without a pen.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nGoogle didn\u0026#39;t design a stylus for the Pixel Fold, but it did implement support for the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), so the device works with third-party USI pens. USI pens don\u0026#39;t have the same functionality as the ‌Apple Pencil‌, lacking features like pressure sensitivity, but the basic stylus functionality is there for those who want it.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple could do something similar to Google. Add support for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ for those who want it, without making it a primary marketing point. That would make the ‌Apple Pencil‌ available for those who want the extra functionality, but it wouldn\u0026#39;t be a necessity. Apple could also design an ‌iPhone‌ Fold-specific ‌Apple Pencil‌ that is sized to the device and able to be charged with it, but it all depends on how Apple wants to market the ‌iPhone‌ Fold.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf it\u0026#39;s marketed as an ‌iPhone‌, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support is unlikely. Apple has long championed a touch-first approach, and no ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for the ‌iPhone‌ clearly separates it from the ‌iPad‌. If it\u0026#39;s marketed as an ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ hybrid device, ‌Apple Pencil‌ support seems like more of a possibility.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple might not be able to implement ‌Apple Pencil‌ support at all because of technical limitations. Rumors suggest that the ‌iPhone‌ Fold is so thin that it doesn\u0026#39;t have the space for the TrueDepth camera hardware for \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFace ID\u003c/a\u003e, so Apple is instead adding a \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTouch ID\u003c/a\u003e button to the device. With space at such a premium, a digitizer layer for the ‌Apple Pencil‌ is probably impossible. Apple also needs to take into account how an ‌Apple Pencil‌ would impact ‌iPhone‌ Fold features like the crease in the middle, and that might add too much complication.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nEven if the first-generation ‌iPhone‌ Fold doesn\u0026#39;t get ‌Apple Pencil‌ support, it could be a feature that Apple adds in the future as display technology improves.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nDo you want ‌Apple Pencil‌ support for the ‌iPhone‌ Fold?

Alongside this, a Menu Bar appears at the top of the display when invoked, exposing app commands in a structured, searchable format similar to macOS. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nInstead of asking users to adapt desktop workflows to a touch-first model, Apple has now explicitly imported desktop interaction styles into iPadOS, addressing a significant number of user complaints about the software limitations of the ‌iPad‌. For users who want to use the ‌iPad‌ with true multitasking and desktop-style workflows, this is one of the most substantive capability upgrades the platform has ever received.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore Powerful Mac Spotlight\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nOn the Mac, Spotlight received its most extensive overhaul to date, transforming it from a passive search tool into an actions-first command interface, similar to third-party apps like Alfred or Raycast. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tahoe-spotlight.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSpotlight in \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emacOS Tahoe\u003c/a\u003e can now execute hundreds of actions directly from the search field.

In ‌FaceTime‌, Live Translation provides real-time translated captions during video calls, allowing participants to speak naturally while reading translations as the conversation unfolds. In phone calls, spoken dialogue can be translated in near real time, with translated audio and on-screen text presented during the call.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple also extended Live Translation to AirPods, enabling real-time spoken translation directly through the earbuds during in-person conversations. When Live Translation is active, speech from another language can be translated on the paired ‌iPhone‌ and played back in the user\u0026#39;s AirPods, while the user\u0026#39;s responses can be translated and spoken aloud by the ‌iPhone‌ for the other participant. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCommunication Screening and Hold Assist\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nCall Screening allows the ‌iPhone‌ to automatically answer calls from unknown numbers on the user\u0026#39;s behalf.

Once the system detects that the call has resumed, it notifies the user to return to the conversation. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIn Messages, Apple introduced more aggressive screening for unknown senders. Messages from numbers that are not in the user\u0026#39;s contacts are automatically routed into a separate area, keeping potential spam and scam attempts out of the main conversation list.\u003cbr/\u003eThis article, \u0026#34;\u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/5-most-important-software-features-introduced-this-year/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe 5 Most Important Apple Software Features Introduced This Year\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#34; first appeared on \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMacRumors.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-5-most-important-apple-software-features-introduced-this-year.2475363/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscuss this article\u003c/a\u003e in our forums\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e"},"content":{"direction":"ltr","content":"2025 was a significant year of advancement for Apple\u0026#39;s software, with a noticeable focus on visual design, productivity, and communication.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nWhile Apple introduced and continued to iterate on a wide range of features throughout the year, several additions stood out for their scope and practical impact across multiple devices.

Apple framed this as a unifying material across platforms rather than a purely aesthetic refresh, with the same visual logic appearing on \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPhone\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPad\u003c/a\u003e, Mac, Apple Watch, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple TV\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIn practice, it is one of Apple\u0026#39;s biggest visual redesigns since the original iOS 7 shift away from skeuomorphism, and it signals a renewed focus on making the interface feel fresh, spatial, playful, and responsive rather than static.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eRevamped iPad Multitasking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nOn the ‌iPad‌, the most consequential change is the introduction of an all-new multitasking system with windows and a macOS-style Menu Bar and cursor in \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiPadOS 26\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iPadOS-26-App-Windowing.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApps can now run in freely resizable windows rather than being constrained to fixed split-screen layouts, allowing multiple overlapping windows to coexist on screen. Alongside this, a Menu Bar appears at the top of the display when invoked, exposing app commands in a structured, searchable format similar to macOS. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nInstead of asking users to adapt desktop workflows to a touch-first model, Apple has now explicitly imported desktop interaction styles into iPadOS, addressing a significant number of user complaints about the software limitations of the ‌iPad‌. For users who want to use the ‌iPad‌ with true multitasking and desktop-style workflows, this is one of the most substantive capability upgrades the platform has ever received.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMore Powerful Mac Spotlight\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nOn the Mac, Spotlight received its most extensive overhaul to date, transforming it from a passive search tool into an actions-first command interface, similar to third-party apps like Alfred or Raycast. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tahoe-spotlight.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSpotlight in \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emacOS Tahoe\u003c/a\u003e can now execute hundreds of actions directly from the search field. Users can create and edit notes, send emails and messages, start timers, run Shortcuts, adjust system settings, and perform app-specific commands, without opening the corresponding app.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple also redesigned Spotlight\u0026#39;s results presentation with richer, more structured browsing views. Instead of returning a flat list of matches, Spotlight now surfaces grouped results for files, applications, actions, and suggestions, allowing users to scan and refine results more quickly.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nSpotlight now includes a built-in clipboard history, allowing users to view and reuse previously copied text or images directly from the Spotlight interface. Apple also integrated an app library-style view, providing a centralized, searchable overview of all installed applications. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLive Translation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nAnother major addition is Live Translation. Real-time translation now operates inside Messages, \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFaceTime\u003c/a\u003e, and the Phone app, translating both text and spoken audio during conversations. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIn Messages, incoming and outgoing text can be translated inline. In ‌FaceTime‌, Live Translation provides real-time translated captions during video calls, allowing participants to speak naturally while reading translations as the conversation unfolds. In phone calls, spoken dialogue can be translated in near real time, with translated audio and on-screen text presented during the call.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nApple also extended Live Translation to AirPods, enabling real-time spoken translation directly through the earbuds during in-person conversations. When Live Translation is active, speech from another language can be translated on the paired ‌iPhone‌ and played back in the user\u0026#39;s AirPods, while the user\u0026#39;s responses can be translated and spoken aloud by the ‌iPhone‌ for the other participant. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCommunication Screening and Hold Assist\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nCall Screening allows the ‌iPhone‌ to automatically answer calls from unknown numbers on the user\u0026#39;s behalf. The system asks the caller to identify themselves and explain the reason for the call, then presents the user with a live transcript of the response before the call is connected.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nWith Hold Assist, when a user is placed on hold during a phone call, the ‌iPhone‌ can remain in the queue on their behalf and monitor the call until a live agent becomes available. Once the system detects that the call has resumed, it notifies the user to return to the conversation. \n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIn Messages, Apple introduced more aggressive screening for unknown senders. Messages from numbers that are not in the user\u0026#39;s contacts are automatically routed into a separate area, keeping potential spam and scam attempts out of the main conversation list.\u003cbr/\u003eThis article, \u0026#34;\u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/5-most-important-software-features-introduced-this-year/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe 5 Most Important Apple Software Features Introduced This Year\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#34;

I padroni di casa sembrano in bambola, così \u003cstrong\u003eAlston\u003c/strong\u003e segna anche il \u003cstrong\u003e7-19\u003c/strong\u003e. Tocca allora a \u003cstrong\u003eBrown\u003c/strong\u003e con un 3+1 risvegliare i suoi e poi Toscano-Anderson fa il resto per il -6 giuliano. Ancora \u003cstrong\u003eAlston\u003c/strong\u003e però non ci sta e nonostante l’\u003cstrong\u003einfortunio\u003c/strong\u003e di \u003cstrong\u003eDiarra\u003c/strong\u003e la Virtus torna subito a \u003cstrong\u003e+10\u003c/strong\u003e. Nel finale però \u003cstrong\u003eRuzzier\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eRamsey\u003c/strong\u003e riducono il distacco dei padroni di casa, così il primo quarto si chiude \u003cstrong\u003e22-25\u003c/strong\u003e. Subito \u003cstrong\u003eDiouf\u003c/strong\u003e apre il periodo con il canestro del +5, Toscano-Anderson risponde con la tripla, ma poi la Virtus si riporta a \u003cstrong\u003e+9\u003c/strong\u003e grazie al parziale di 4-0 chiuso da \u003cstrong\u003eAkele\u003c/strong\u003e. Trieste ci prova, ma \u003cstrong\u003eDiouf\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eVildoza\u003c/strong\u003e allungano anche a +11 il vantaggio bolognese. \u003cstrong\u003eBrooks\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eRoss\u003c/strong\u003e piazzano il -7, ma gli ospiti rispondono con \u003cstrong\u003eTaylor\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eMorgan\u003c/strong\u003e per il +12. I padroni di casa però tornano sotto alla fine del primo tempo con un \u003cstrong\u003eparziale di 7-0\u003c/strong\u003e, chiuso dalla bomba di \u003cstrong\u003eCandussi\u003c/strong\u003e, che significa \u003cstrong\u003e39-44. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl rientro in campo \u003cstrong\u003eRoss\u003c/strong\u003e segna subito il -3, ma \u003cstrong\u003eNiang\u003c/strong\u003e ristabilisce presto il +5 per la Virtus. Tocca poi a \u003cstrong\u003eBrown\u003c/strong\u003e per due volte provare a riportare sotto Trieste, che si spinge fino al -3, ma \u003cstrong\u003eMorgan\u003c/strong\u003e e compagni tengono botta (+5). La Virtus ora è in difficoltà, i padroni di casa però non ne approfittano, complice anche l’\u003cstrong\u003einfortunio\u003c/strong\u003e di Ross, così \u003cstrong\u003eAlston\u003c/strong\u003e rimette i suoi a +8. Trieste però spinge ancora, tanto che \u003cstrong\u003eRamsey\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eToscano-Anderson\u003c/strong\u003e la riportano sotto fino al \u003cstrong\u003e52-53\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eVildoza \u003c/strong\u003ea fine quarto però rimette Bologna a +3. L’ultimo periodo si apre con due canestri in fila di \u003cstrong\u003eNiang\u003c/strong\u003e che significano \u003cstrong\u003e+7\u003c/strong\u003e per Bologna, Trieste trova poi anche il -2 con \u003cstrong\u003eToscano-Anderson\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eDeangeli\u003c/strong\u003e, ma Niang tiene a distanza le V nere (+4). Tocca allora a \u003cstrong\u003eRamsey\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eToscano-Anderson \u003c/strong\u003erimettere la gara in parità sul \u003cstrong\u003e62-62\u003c/strong\u003e. Bologna non ci sta, così \u003cstrong\u003eMorgan\u003c/strong\u003e e \u003cstrong\u003eAlston \u003c/strong\u003ela rimettono a +4. \u003cstrong\u003eBrown\u003c/strong\u003e e compagni ci provano fino alla fine, tornando anche a -2, ma il \u003cstrong\u003e3+1\u003c/strong\u003e di \u003cstrong\u003eAlston\u003c/strong\u003e a pochi secondi dal termine è decisivo per la chiusura del match.
