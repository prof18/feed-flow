Most websites with an RSS feed don't share the article's content because they want you to visit their website. For this reason, FeedFlow always opens the original website, but you can choose the browser you want.

For example, you can open an article in DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus with all the trackers disabled and then clear all the navigation data. This way, the reading experience is separated from your main browser instance.

**FeedFlow also offers a reader mode** that downloads the full content of the article and renders it in a clutter-free view.
