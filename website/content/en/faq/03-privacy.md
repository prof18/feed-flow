**Yes!** FeedFlow is designed with privacy in mind:

- ✅ No trackers
- ✅ No analytics
- ✅ No data collection
- ✅ Open source - you can verify the code yourself

Only anonymized crash and error reports are collected to help improve the RSS parsing mechanism. You can disable even these in the app settings if you prefer.
